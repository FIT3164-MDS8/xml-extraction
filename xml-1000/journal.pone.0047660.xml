        <p>Water buffalo and yellow cattle are the two of the most important natural reservoir hosts for <italic>Schistosoma japonicum</italic> in endemic areas of China, although their susceptibility differs, with water buffalo being less conducive to the growth and development of <italic>S. japonicum.</italic> Results from the current study show that the general morphology and ultrastructure of adult schistosomes derived from the two hosts also differed. Using high-throughput microarray technology, we also compared the gene expression profiles of adult schistosomes derived from the two hosts. We identified genes that were differentially expressed in worms from the two natural hosts. Further analysis revealed that genes associated with protein kinase and phosphatase, the stimulus response, and lipid and nucleotide metabolism were overexpressed, whereas genes associated with reproduction, anatomical structure morphogenesis and multifunctional motif were underexpressed in schistosomes from water buffalo. These differentially expressed genes were mainly involved in nucleotide, energy, lipid metabolism, energy metabolism, transcription, transport and signaling pathway. This suggests that they are key molecules affecting the survival and development of schistosomes in different natural host species. The results of this study add to current understanding of the interplay between parasites and their natural hosts, and provide valuable information for the screening of vaccine candidates or new drug targets against schistosomiasis in the natural reservoir hosts in endemic areas.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Schistosomiasis is one of the most prevalent zoonotic diseases in the world, affecting approximately 250 million people and posing a risk to another 600 million <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047660-World1">[1]</xref>. Schistosomiasis control in China has been remarkably successful, with the number of cases being reduced from 11 000 000 to 326 000 by the end of 2010 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047660-Lei1">[2]</xref>. Endemic areas of uncontrolled schistosomiasis are mostly distributed in the marsh, lake and mountainous regions of China <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047660-Zheng1">[3]</xref>. Epidemiology surveys have shown that domestic animals also have an important role in the transmission of schistosomiasis in these areas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047660-Zheng2">[4]</xref>. Water buffalo and yellow cattle are the two major domestic animals reared in schistosomiasis-endemic areas of China as they are able to spread more eggs into the environment compared with human and other animal hosts. They are considered to be the main transmission source (i.e. reservoir hosts) for schistosomiasis in China and, therefore, should have an important role for prevention strategies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047660-Shen1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047660-Liu1">[6]</xref>. In endemic areas, control measures, including chemotherapy for bovine hosts, have both improved the health status of animals and reduced the spread of schistosomiasis in humans; however, the need for chemotherapy is ongoing and costly in terms of material resources and human input. Therefore, the development of an effective vaccine for animals and/or humans is a more sustainable choice for the control of this debilitating disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047660-McManus1">[7]</xref>.</p>
      <p><italic>Schistosoma japonicum</italic> has a wide range of host species, with at least 46 species of mammal, other than humans, known to be naturally infected by <italic>S. japonicum</italic>, including a variety of domestic and wild animals, although only some are a schistosomiasis threat to humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047660-McGarvey1">[8]</xref>. Previous studies revealed the variability in the susceptibility of different types of host to <italic>S. japonicum</italic> infection, with yellow cattle, goats, mice and rabbits being more susceptible for infection compared with water buffalo, rats, pigs and horses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047660-He1">[9]</xref>. In addition, the parasite clearance phenomenon has been observed in water buffalo after a certain period of infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047660-Luo1">[10]</xref>. Parasites that survive in this host also showed substantial changes in morphology, being shorter in length, having poorly developed gonads, demonstrating a lower rate of worm pairing and also of spawning by female worms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047660-He2">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047660-Yang1">[12]</xref>. However, the factors that determine such differences in <italic>S. japonicum</italic> infection among natural reservoir hosts remain to be clarified.</p>
      <p>Recent studies in our laboratory revealed that schistosomula of <italic>S. japonicum</italic> from susceptible host BALB/c mice, less susceptible host Wistar rat and the non-permissive host <italic>Microtus fortis</italic> displayed different expression profiles at the transcript and protein level <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047660-Peng1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047660-Hong1">[14]</xref>. The studies suggested that investigating the gene or protein expression difference in worms from different hosts could provide useful information for understanding the mechanism determining the survival, development and maturing of schistosomes in their hosts. In addition, the studies also suggested that the gene or protein expression profiles in schistosomes from natural hosts would be different with those from laboratory animals. Therefore, to better elucidate the developmental mechanism of schistosomes in their natural hosts, as well as to identify the molecules that might affecting schistosome development, we infected water buffalo and yellow cattle with <italic>S. japonicum</italic>, and analyzed and compared the gene expression profiles of the parasites from the two natural hosts using a microarray technique. Our results are likely to be helpful for screening vaccine candidates or new drug targets for the control of schistosomiasis in the natural reservoir hosts in endemic areas.</p>

        <title>Worm Collection and Ultrastructural Observation</title>
        <p>The animals were sacrificed 7 weeks post-infection and the parasites were perfused through the hepatic portal vein. The male and female worms were detached manually, counted and their lengths and widths were measured by the same investigator. Worm samples were collected and stored in RNAlater (Amibion). The remaining worms were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde phosphate buffer solution after washing with PBS (pH 7.4) three times, with a 15 min interval, and then fixed for 1.5 h with 1% osmic acid, and then washed three times as above, dehydrated with gradient alcohol (30%, 50%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95% and 100%), vacuum dried and spurted for 3 min by an ion sputtering instrument. The samples were observed with JEOL (JSM-6380LV, Japan) by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The samples were further dehydrated with acetone twice, embedded in an embedding medium, cut ultrathinly for a 70-nm section and then observed using an electron microscope (Hitachi H-600, Japan) by transmission electron microscopy (TEM).</p>

        <p>Microarrays were scanned using an Agilent Microarray Scanner (G2565BA) at 550 nm. Hybridized slides were scanned as tiff files and processed with the Feature Extraction 9.5.3.1 Image Analysis program (Agilent) to produce standardized data for statistical analysis. All slides were assessed for background evenness by viewing the tiff image using Feature Extraction. Feature-extracted data were analyzed using GENESPRING (version 7.3.1; Agilent Technologies/Silicon Genetics, Redwood City, CA). Microarray data were normalized using a normalization scenario for â€˜Agilent FE one-colorâ€™, which including â€˜Data Transformation: Set measurements less than 5.0 to 5.0â€², â€˜Per Chip: Normalize to 50th percentileâ€™ and â€˜Per Gene: Normalize to medianâ€™.</p>
        <p>Data sets were further analyzed based on one-colour experiments published previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047660-Patterson1">[17]</xref>. The gProcessed Signal values were determined in GENESPRING using Agilentâ€™s Feature Extraction software, including aspects of signal/noise ratio, spot morphology and homogeneity. The gProcessed Signal represents the signal after localized background subtraction and includes corrections for surface trends. Features were deemed â€˜Absentâ€™ when the processed signal intensity was less than twice the value of the processed signal error value; â€˜Marginalâ€™ when the measured intensity was at a saturated value or if there was a substantial amount of variation in the signal intensity within the pixels of a particular feature. Features that were neither Absent nor Marginal were deemed â€˜Presentâ€™. Data points were included only if they were Present or Present, Absent and probes or contigs were retained if all data points were Present or Present, Absent. The microarray data were submitted to the GEO public database, under the accession number GSE24615.

        <title>Validation of Microarray Results</title>
        <p>A subset of genes predicted to be differentially expressed in microarray analysis was selected for validation using real-time RT-PCR.

Total amplified RNA (1 Âµg) from mixed parasites sample from each animal in every group was used for reverse transcription (RT) in a final volume of 20 ÂµL using PrimerScript RT kit with gDNA Eraser (Takara, Cat# DRR047). Products were amplified using the SYBR Premix Ex Taq (Takara, Cat#DRR041A) in an ABI 7500 Realtime System (Applied Biosystems) with the following profile: 50Â°C for 2 min, 95Â°C for 30 s; 40 cycles of 95Â°C for 5 s and 60Â°C for 34 s; 95Â°C for 15 s and 60Â°C for 1 min. Each reaction was performed using 20 ÂµL of cDNA from the RT reaction, to a final volume of 50 ÂµL. Expression levels of <italic>S. japonicum</italic> NADH dehydrogenase (Genebank AY812950) were used as an endogenous control within each sample.

        <title>Comparative Ultrastructure of Schistosomes Derived from Water Buffalo and Yellow Cattle</title>
        <p>In addition to the general differences known to occur between hosts, including worm recovery rate, and worm length and width <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047660-Yang1">[12]</xref>, the surface topography and internal structures at the ultrastructural level were also found to differ between schistosomes harvested from water buffalo and yellow cattle. Based on SEM of male schistosome worms derived from water buffalo, the oral sucker was crimpled, tension was attenuated or loosed, the width of the border spine decreased in the ventral sucker, and the surface crest and sensory papillae were flattened in the posterior segment of gynecophoral canal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0047660-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). Female schistosomes collected from water buffalo showed invagination and collapse of the spines and sensory papillae on the back of the oral sucker, a depressed ventral sucker, a poorly distinguished genital pore, and fewer crest and sensory papillae in middle of the integumentum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0047660-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). By contrast, female schistosomes from yellow cattle showed relatively normal surface topography, with more spines and sensory papillae in the oral sucker, an evaginated ventral sucker, an obvious genital pore next to the ventral sucker, a compact and regular tegumental ridge and crest and sensory papillae in the middle of the integumentum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0047660-g001">Figs 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0047660-g002">2</xref>).</p>
        <p>Comparing male worms from yellow cattle with those from water buffalo using TEM showed that those from water buffalo had more vacuolar structures in the tegument, consistent with the collapse and loose surface observed by SEM, and the organelles of cytoplasm had dissolved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0047660-g003">Fig. 3</xref>); the female worms from water buffalo showed no obvious differences in the tegument compared with worms from yellow cattle, although their internal microvilli were shorter and fewer than in worms from yellow cattle(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0047660-g004">Fig. 4</xref>).</p>

        <title>Global Gene Expression Profiles in Schistosomes from Water Buffalo and Yellow Cattle</title>
        <p>Three biological replicates were set for worms from each host, and the correlation of the biological replicates was 0.99 for worms from individual animal of each host. In total, 1484 transcripts (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05) were applied for hierarchical clustering. It was possible to identify different profiles from the schistosomes from water buffalo (Group B) and yellow cattle (Group C). The genes of schistosomes from the two different hosts separated into two main clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0047660-g005">Fig. 5I</xref>). To evaluate the overall structure of the data, we plotted the first two principal components using a principal component analysis (PCA). This analysis separated the data into two subgroups, clustering together the biological replicates, and separating the samples by the host from which the schistosomes were derived (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0047660-g005">Fig. 5II</xref>).

        <title>Comparison of Gene Expression Differences in Schistosomes Derived from Water Buffalo and Yellow Cattle</title>
        <p>Gene expression is most abundant and diverse in adult schistosomes because of the need for development, movement, evading host immune attack, the acquisition and metabolism of nutrients, and reproduction. The gene expression difference analysis revealed that, compared with schistosomes from yellow cattle, some genes involved in protein kinase and phosphatase, stimulus response, lipid metabolism, nucleotide metabolism, transcription and translation, were overexpressed in schistosomes from water buffalo, whereas other genes associated with reproduction, anatomical structure morphogenesis and multifunctional motifs were underexpressed. The differential expression of these genes might affect the survival and development of schistosomes in the two natural hosts.</p>

          <title>Protein kinase and phosphatase</title>
          <p>Protein phosphatase has an important role, alongside protein kinase, in dephosphorylation and/or phosphorylation, which controls a variety of processes, including cell division and growth, signal transduction and metabolism, and influences events ranging from the initiation of DNA replication to vertebrate axis formation to apoptosis. The actions of both pro- and anti-apoptotic factors are often affected by the modulation of the phosphorylation status of key elements of the apoptotic process. Many protein kinases act in apoptosis, of which the serine/threonine protein kinases are known to have a role in apoptosis. Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) is a serine/threonine kinase that primes DNA replication and induces mitosis; it also regulates schistosome gene expression associated with embryogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047660-Freitas1">[30]</xref> and worm paring <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047660-Osman1">[31]</xref> via the tumor growth factor (TGF)-Î² signaling pathway; recent studies have also reported a novel role in block differentiation for CDK6 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047660-Grossel1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047660-Matsuura1">[33]</xref>.

Therefore, the overexpression of CDK6 and PP2A revealed by our study in schistosomes from water buffalo would be predicted to block cell differentiation and promote cell apoptosis, resulting in worm clearance and the development of mild pathological damage in water buffalo (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0047660-t002">Table 2</xref>).</p>

          <title>Stimulus response associated with the nervous system and transport</title>
          <p>Schistosomes have a central nervous system and a peripheral sensory nervous system, which help them to attack hosts and reach nutrient-rich areas such as the liver portal vein and intestinal veins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047660-TheSchistosomajaponicum1">[35]</xref>. The neural system and its regulation are sensitive to stimulus. Protocadherins are predominantly expressed in the nervous system, and constitute the largest subgroup within the cadherin superfamily of calcium-dependent cellâ€“cell adhesion molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047660-Morishita1">[36]</xref>; glutamate and its receptor are important neurotransmitters in the central nervous system, leading to a complex signal transduction response; Rab3 is a neuronal GTP-binding protein of synaptic vesicles that may function in neurotransmitter release. Other investigators demonstrated that Rab3 is not in itself essential for synaptic membrane traffic but functions to modulate the basic release machinery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047660-Schluter1">[37]</xref>. The substance exchange between schistosomes and their hosts requires many transporters; therefore, some genes involved in H<sup>+</sup> transport and nucleoside transport that were also found to be overexpressed in schistosomes from water buffalo, as well as genes involved in neural system regulation, could enable the parasite to adapt to the host environment, enabling them to survive and develop in the host.</p>

          <title>Genes associated with metabolism</title>
          <p>Schistosomes are unable to complete lipid and nucleotide metabolism without their host as they are incapable of the <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis of sterols or free fatty acids and must use complex precursors from the host <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047660-Brouwers1">[38]</xref>. The elongase of the very long chain fatty acid (ELOVL) family is responsible for the synthesis of very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs). The ELOVL family consists of seven members: ELOVL1â€“7, which are thought to carry out substrate-specific elongation with fatty acids of various lengths and to regulate fatty acid metabolism. In water buffalo, only a few parasites were able to survive and mature. The ELOVL genes were upregulated (CUST_5733 and CUST_10029) in adult schistosomes from water buffalo, perhaps as a result of a compensation mechanism in a less-susceptible host to enable worm growth and development.</p>
          <p>Nucleotide metabolism is crucial for schistosomes, but they are unable to synthesize purines by themselves, depending instead on a supply from their host <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047660-Liu2">[39]</xref>. The current study found that several nucleotide metabolism-associated genes were overexpressed in schistosomes from water buffalo (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0047660-t002">Table 2</xref>). Nucleoside diphosphate kinase (EC 2.7.4.6) is a ubiquitous enzyme that catalyzes phosphorylation of nucleoside 5â€²-diphosphate, with the exception of ADP, to the corresponding triphosphate. In addition, NDP kinases have been shown to have additional regulatory functions for growth and developmental control, signal transduction, transcription, activation of GTP-binding proteins and tumour metastasis suppression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047660-Krejcova1">[40]</xref>. The structure of NDP kinases is highly conserved from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> to humans (43% identity) and they are believed to be housekeeping enzymes for DNA and RNA synthesis. However, NDK was upregulated in schistosomes from water buffalo, suggesting that it is also important for worm growth and development in different hosts.</p>
          <p>Homeobox genes have fundamental roles in development; in particular, the LIM-homeobox subfamily and Iroquois homeobox family both have transcription factor regulation activity. The primary structure of LIM-homeobox genes has been remarkably conserved through evolution. Previous studies revealed a prominent involvement of LIM-homeodomain proteins in tissue patterning and differentiation, and their function in neural patterning is evident in many organisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047660-Hobert1">[41]</xref>. Iroquois homeobox factors are a family of homeodomain transcription factors that have a role in many developmental processes. The <italic>Iro</italic> genes function early in development to specify the identity of diverse territories of the body, such as the dorsal head and dorsal mesothorax of <italic>Drosophila</italic> and the neural plate of <italic>Xenopus</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047660-Cavodeassi1">[42]</xref>. Pumilio proteins are proposed to have a conserved primordial function in the maintenance of proliferation in stem cells through post-transcriptional regulation. Recent research has also reported that they act as translational repression proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047660-Parisi1">[43]</xref>. Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF3) has a central role in the process of eukaryotic translation initiation.

          <p>The genes associated with lipid and nucleotide metabolism, transcription and translation and those were overexpressed in schistosomes from water buffalo, might reflect a response to the requirement for growth and development in the environment of less-susceptible host.

          <p>Long-term host and/or parasite survival depends upon successful modulation of the acute pathological response, which is induced by egg antigens. Cass <italic>et al.</italic> identified egg secretome of <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic> and found that it comprised 188 proteins, involved in redox balance, molecular chaperoning and protein folding, development and signaling, scavenging and metabolic pathways, and immune response modulation. After initial infection, egg granuloma formation in the presence of pro-inflammatory cytokines normally results in a shift to a T-helper 2 (Th2)-type anti-inflammatory cytokine environment, directly in response to egg-secreted antigens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047660-Grzych1">[45]</xref>. The egg-secreted protein (ESP) localized to the integral membrane, is underexpressed in schistosomes sampled from water buffalo, which might be why there was no obvious shift from a Th1 to Th2-type immune response after schistosome infection, as previously reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0047660-Yang1">[12]</xref>.</p>
          <p>Taurine is an amino acid that essential during fetal life and appears to be vital for the growth of the fetus and for the development of the central nervous system.

Keratin is a type of scleroprotein that has abundant cysteine and disulfide bonds, and is involved in egg-shell protein formation in schistosomes. The scleroproteinaceous schistosome egg shell is lined internally with a vitelline membrane, within which the miracidium develops. The egg shell is a hardened and tanned structure made from crosslinked proteins.

        <p>KEGG pathway analysis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0047660-t004">Table 4</xref>) of differential expressed genes suggested that these genes are involved in many crucial cellular events. The genes were mainly associated with nucleotide metabolism (purine and pyrimidine metabolism), energy metabolism (oxidative phosphorylation), lipid metabolism (sphingolipid metabolism), glycan biosynthesis and metabolism (glycosphingolipid biosynthesis), genetic information processing(transcription), transport and catabolism(lysosome), environmental information processing (Wnt signaling pathway and neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction).</p>

        <p>In this study, we compared schistosomes from the <italic>S. japonicum-</italic>susceptible natural host (yellow cattle) with those from the less-susceptible natural host (water buffalo) at both the ultrastructural and transcriptional level. Ultrastructure observations showed that worms from water buffalo have a collapsed and loose surface, with fewer spines and sensory papillae, dissolved cytoplasmic organelles and more vacuole structures in the male worm tegument. The gene expression analysis of the adult worms showed that the differentially expressed genes participated mainly in nucleotide, energy, lipid metabolism, energy metabolism, transcription, transport and signaling pathway and so on. Thus, the differential expression of these genes might affect the survival and development of the schistosome in different natural hosts.</p>
        <p>The results from the current study provide a better understanding of the interplay between parasites and their natural hosts, and also valuable information for the screening of schistosome vaccine candidates. If a transmission-blocking veterinary vaccine can be put into practice in combination with other control strategies, such as human chemotherapy, elimination of <italic>S. japonicum</italic> from China, and other endemic areas, might be achievable.</p>
