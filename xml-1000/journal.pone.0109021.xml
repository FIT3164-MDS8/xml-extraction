<title>Background</title>
<p>Multiple studies suggest creatine mediates anti-oxidant activity in addition to its established role in cellular energy metabolism. The functional significance for the heart has yet to be established, but antioxidant activity could contribute to the cardioprotective effect of creatine in ischaemia/reperfusion injury.</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>Objectives</title>
<p>To determine whether intracellular creatine levels influence responses to acute reactive oxygen species (ROS) exposure in the intact beating heart. We hypothesised that mice with elevated creatine due to over-expression of the creatine transporter (CrT-OE) would be relatively protected, while mice with creatine-deficiency (GAMT KO) would fare worse.</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>Methods and Results</title>
<p>CrT-OE mice were pre-selected for creatine levels 20–100% above wild-type using <italic>in</italic> <italic>vivo</italic> <sup>1</sup>H<sup>–</sup>MRS. Hearts were perfused in isovolumic Langendorff mode and cardiac function monitored throughout. After 20 min equilibration, hearts were perfused with either H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> 0.5 µM (30 min), or the anti-neoplastic drug doxorubicin 15 µM (100 min). Protein carbonylation, creatine kinase isoenzyme activities and phospho-PKCδ expression were quantified in perfused hearts as markers of oxidative damage and apoptotic signalling. Wild-type hearts responded to ROS challenge with a profound decline in contractile function that was ameliorated by co-administration of catalase or dexrazoxane as positive controls. In contrast, the functional deterioration in CrT-OE and GAMT KO hearts was indistinguishable from wild-type controls, as was the extent of oxidative damage and apoptosis. Exogenous creatine supplementation also failed to protect hearts from doxorubicin-induced dysfunction.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Intracellular creatine levels do not influence the response to acute ROS challenge in the intact beating heart, arguing against creatine exerting (patho-)physiologically relevant anti-oxidant activity.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The canonical role of creatine (Cr) is the transfer and buffering of chemical energy <italic>via</italic> the creatine kinase (CK) reaction, linking ATP production to ATP utilization in cells with high energy demand <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109021-Neubauer1">[1]</xref>. However, multiple studies have attributed creatine with both direct and indirect anti-oxidant activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109021-Berneburg1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109021-Sestili1">[6]</xref>. For example, there is <italic>in</italic> <italic>vitro</italic> evidence for direct scavenging of free radicals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109021-Lawler1">[5]</xref>, protection of mitochondrial DNA from oxidative damage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109021-Guidi1">[4]</xref>; and up-regulation of enzymes involved in intracellular oxidative defences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109021-Young1">[7]</xref>. Patients with creatine deficiency syndrome are reported to have increased oxidative stress and ROS-induced apoptotic cell loss <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109021-Alcaide1">[8]</xref>, while creatine supplementation in senescent mice improved neurobehavioral outcomes and prolonged median survival with a trend towards lower reactive oxygen species (ROS) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109021-Bender1">[9]</xref>. More specifically in the heart, our own work has shown that elevating intracellular creatine <italic>via</italic> over-expression of the creatine transporter (CrT) reduces myocardial stunning and ischaemia/reperfusion injury <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109021-Lygate1">[10]</xref>. However, the extent to which anti-oxidant effects may contribute to cardioprotection has not been fully elucidated.</p>
<p>One way to assess this is to challenge intact hearts with known sources of oxidative stress in order to determine whether intracellular creatine levels influence the acute response. For example, hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) is a relatively stable, membrane diffusible, non-radical species of ROS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109021-Schroder1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109021-Avner1">[12]</xref> and the exogenous administration of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> has been reported to cause a degree of cardiac dysfunction similar to ischemia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109021-Canton1">[13]</xref>. Cardiotoxicity predominately arises from the generation of reactive oxygen intermediates such as hydroxyl radicals and singlet oxygen leading to peroxidation of membrane phospholipids, altered membrane permeability, and irreversible loss of cell integrity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109021-Janero1">[14]</xref>. Additional mechanisms of toxicity may be related to direct inhibition of glycolytic ATP generation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109021-Chatham1">[15]</xref>, or to redox regulation of regulatory kinases and sarcomeric proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109021-Avner1">[12]</xref>.</p>
<p>A more clinically relevant source of oxidative stress are the antineoplastic anthracycline drugs (e.g. doxorubicin). These are widely used and effective, but dosing is constrained by cardiotoxic side effects which can lead to heart failure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109021-Maslov1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109021-Gratia1">[18]</xref>. Doxorubicin is known to accumulate in mitochondrial membranes of cardiomyocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109021-TokarskaSchlattner1">[17]</xref>, where a number of complex interactions may occur leading to the generation of superoxide anion, hydrogen peroxide and subsequently hydroxyl radicals <italic>via</italic> a Fenton reaction with iron. The result is oxidation of key proteins with mitochondrial proteins particularly vulnerable, ultimately leading to ATP depletion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109021-Maslov1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109021-Gratia1">[18]</xref>.</p>
<p>Modulating intracellular creatine levels in the heart is not straightforward since cardiomyocytes cannot synthesize creatine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109021-Snow1">[19]</xref> and increased dietary creatine does not result in elevated tissue levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109021-Boehm1">[20]</xref>. To circumvent this we have previously created mice that constitutively over-express myocardial CrT (CrT-OE) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109021-Wallis1">[21]</xref>. For the purpose of studying creatine-free hearts, we used mice with knockout of the key biosynthetic enzyme, guanidinoacetate N-methyltransferase (GAMT KO), which have a whole body creatine-deficiency as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109021-Schmidt1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109021-tenHove1">[23]</xref>.</p>
<p>Thus the objective of this study was to determine whether the anti-oxidant effects attributed to creatine <italic>in</italic> <italic>vitro</italic> have physiological significance to the intact heart. To address this we measured the effect of acute oxidative stress caused by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> or doxorubicin on cardiac function in Langendorff perfused mouse hearts. Specifically, we hypothesized that GAMT KO mice with zero creatine in the heart would be more susceptible to ROS-mediated dysfunction, and conversely, that CrT-OE hearts with elevated intracellular creatine would be protected.</p>

<p>Creatine transporter overexpressing and GAMT KO mice were bred in-house and genotyped as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109021-Wallis1">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109021-tenHove1">[23]</xref>. Both strains are congenic to C57BL/6J and wild-type littermates (WT) were used as controls. Additional experiments made use of C57BL/6J male mice purchased from Harlan, UK. Mice were housed in specific pathogen-free cages with a 12 h light-dark cycle, controlled humidity and temperature (20–22°C), fed Teklad Global 16% Protein Rodent Diet (naturally creatine-free) and water <italic>ad libitum</italic>. From 6 weeks of age, GAMT KO mice were housed per genotype to prevent creatine ingestion <italic>via</italic> coprophagia. All experiments were approved by institutional ethical review committee and conform to the UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 incorporating European Directive 2010/63/EU.</p>

<title><italic>In vivo</italic> <sup>1</sup>H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<sup>1</sup>H-MRS)</title>
<p>Myocardial creatine [Cr] was measured non-invasively on a 9.4 T (400 MHz) MR system (Agilent Technologies) using a quadrature-driven birdcage resonator (Rapid Biomedical). CrT- OE mice were anaesthetized with isoflurane and maintained at 1.5–2% in oxygen. Cardiac metabolite signals from a 2 µl voxel, placed in the interventricular septum, were acquired using a double-gated, double spin-echo sequence. Creatine signal was normalized to the water signal and total [Cr] estimated from the average creatine/water ratio using a calibration curve as reported previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109021-Schneider1">[24]</xref>.</p>

<title>Heart Perfusions</title>
<p>Mice were anaesthetised by intra-peritoneal injection of pentobarbitone 140 mg/kg. Beating hearts were rapidly excised, cannulated and perfused in the isovolumic Langendorff mode at 80 mmHg perfusion pressure, 37°C with Krebs-Henseleit (KH) buffer continuously gassed with 95% O<sub>2</sub>/5% CO<sub>2</sub> (pH 7.4) containing (in mM): NaCl 120, KCl 4.7, MgSO<sub>4</sub>.7H<sub>2</sub>O 1.2, NaHCO<sub>3</sub> 25, KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> 1.2, CaCl<sub>2</sub>.H<sub>2</sub>O 1.8, glucose 11. Cardiac function was assessed using a fluid-filled cling film balloon inserted <italic>via</italic> the mitral valve into the left ventricle (LV), and connected <italic>via</italic> a line to a pressure transducer (Memscap) and a Powerlab/8 SP system (AD Instruments). The intraventricular volume was adjusted to achieve an initial LV diastolic pressure of 10–15 mmHg <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109021-tenHove1">[23]</xref>. Functional parameters were averaged for ∼80 cardiac cycles at 5 min perfusion intervals. Left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP) was calculated as the difference between systolic (SP) and diastolic pressures (DP) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109021-Ogino1">[25]</xref>. Rate pressure product (RPP) was determined as the product of heart rate and LVDP. At the end of each perfusion, hearts were freeze clamped using Wollenberger tongs, cooled in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80°C until further analysis.</p>

<title>Pilot Study 1: H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> dose finding</title>
<p>The effect of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> on <italic>ex-vivo</italic> function was tested in hearts from C57BL/6J mice at the following concentrations: 200 µM, 100 µM, 50 µM, 5 µM, 1 µM and 0.5 µM (n = 3 for each). Stability of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in KH buffer was checked spectrophotometrically using Amplex red hydrogen peroxide/peroxidase assay kit (Invitrogen) and was found to be within 4% and 9% of starting values after 30 min and 60 min perfusion, respectively. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> KH buffer was therefore always made fresh immediately prior to the perfusion experiment. Perfusion with the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> scavenger, catalase (150 U/ml, Sigma Aldrich), was used as a positive control (n = 4 per group). Following 20 min equilibration: group 1 was perfused with 0.5 µM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for 30 min; group 2 received 20 min pre-treatment with 150 U/ml catalase.</p>

<title>Pilot Study 2: Doxorubicin dose finding</title>
<p>Doxorubicin hydrochloride (Dox) (Sigma Aldrich) stock (10 mg/vial) was reconstituted in Milipore-filtered water to a concentration of 10 mM and kept in frozen aliquots away from light until use.</p>
<p>A dose of 15 µM administered over 80 min was chosen from the literature since this has been shown to cause a significant reduction in perfused rat heart function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109021-Pelikan1">[26]</xref>. This dose was confirmed experimentally in perfused C57BL/6J hearts (n = 3) with and without 20 min pre-treatment with the iron-chelator dexrazoxane 300 µM as a positive control (n = 5) (Cardioxane, Novartis).</p>

A dose of 0.5 µM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was therefore chosen for all subsequent perfusions since the deleterious effects were observable over the time course of perfusion, without being too rapid to detect differences in responses between groups. Furthermore, catalase treatment fully inhibited the effect of 0.5 µM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> on LVDP indicating that positive modulation of experimental outcome was achievable at this dose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0109021-g001">Figure 1B</xref>).</p>

<p>Perfusion with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> led to a decline in all LV functional parameters that were virtually indistinguishable between GAMT KO and WT hearts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0109021-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). A similar response was observed for CrT-OE hearts versus WT controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0109021-g002">Figure 2B</xref>), with the exception of significant differences at single-time points for end-diastolic pressure (t = 30 min, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0109021-g002">Figure 2B</xref>) and rate pressure product (t = 5 min, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0109021-g002">Figure 2B</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This is the first study to examine whether intracellular creatine levels influence the response to acute oxidative stress in the intact beating heart. Here we show that two different ROS sources, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and doxorubicin, both cause terminal decline in <italic>ex</italic> <italic>vivo</italic> mouse cardiac function.</p>
<p>This functional deterioration was unaltered in hearts with intracellular creatine ∼75% higher than controls, or in hearts with a complete deficiency of creatine. This was confirmed at the molecular level by measurement of carbonylation, indicating that exposure of proteins to oxidative damage was not influenced by creatine levels. This argues against creatine having significant anti-oxidant activity in the intact heart under acute pathological conditions.</p>
<p>These findings provide insight into our previous report in CrT-OE mice, which showed that similarly elevated levels of myocardial creatine protected against ischaemia/reperfusion injury both <italic>in</italic> <italic>vivo</italic> and <italic>ex</italic> <italic>vivo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109021-Lygate1">[10]</xref>. Since I/R injury is associated with a burst of ROS upon reperfusion, then the anti-oxidant effects attributed to creatine could account, in part, for the protective mechanism. Our current work supports the view that the cardio-protective effects of creatine against I/R injury are unrelated to antioxidant activity and are therefore most likely attributable to improved cardiac energetics and protection against mPTP opening as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109021-Lygate3">[33]</xref>. These protective mechanisms in CrT-OE mice include increased energy reserve in the form of PCr/ATP ratio and glycogen storage, as well as increased energy release from ATP hydrolysis. Since these positive energetic adaptations did not confer protection against acute oxidative stress, suggests that energetic imbalance is not the major cause of dysfunction under these hyper-acute conditions.</p>
<p>One possibility is that the experimental conditions were too harsh to observe a protective effect of creatine in the current study and that subtle effects may have been missed. Certainly, both ROS sources had a rapid and profound effect resulting in irreversible decline and complete cardiac arrest within 30 min for H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> perfusion and 100 min for doxorubicin. Nevertheless, we demonstrated <italic>via</italic> the use of positive controls that this pathology could be beneficially modified. For example, catalase converts two molecules of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to O<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O and was effective in completely protecting against H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> –induced damage.</p>
<p>Similarly, addition of the iron-chelator dexrazoxane altered the time-course of doxorubicin-induced dysfunction, presumably by preventing the formation of hydroxyl radicals <italic>via</italic> the iron-dependent Fenton reaction. It should also be noted that the concentration of 0.5 µM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is within the range of estimated exposure levels for cardiomyocytes under pathophysiological conditions, e.g. ischaemia/reperfusion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109021-Schroder1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109021-Avner1">[12]</xref>. Likewise, the concentration of doxorubicin we used is similar to the clinically relevant dose observed in plasma of patients after bolus injection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109021-TokarskaSchlattner3">[34]</xref>. We therefore believe that these are meaningful experimental models and that a robust anti-oxidant effect of creatine would have been readily detectable.</p>
<p>Previous reports have demonstrated cardioprotective effects of exogenously administered phosphocreatine (PCr) in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> perfused rat hearts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109021-Zucchi1">[35]</xref>. Since creatine is inter-converted to PCr <italic>via</italic> the creatine kinase reaction, it is worth considering why our findings are in apparent disagreement. The key difference is that PCr must exert any protective effect extracellularly, since it is too polar to cross the plasma membrane and is not a substrate for uptake <italic>via</italic> the creatine transporter. That we failed to observe protection from addition of exogenous creatine suggests that the phosphoryl group has functional significance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109021-Zucchi1">[35]</xref>. Exogenous PCr has been shown to directly bind to phospholipid-containing membranes, altering structure and conformation of membrane phospholipids thus protecting membranes from permeabilization by doxorubicin-induced oxidative stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109021-Anyukhovsky1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109021-TokarskaSchlattner4">[37]</xref>.</p>

<title>Limitations</title>
<p>Although GAMT KO mice are entirely creatine-free, they do accumulate the creatine precursor guanidinoacetate (GA) to relatively high levels, including in the heart. GA can participate in the CK reaction, but the kinetics are insufficient to compensate for the energetic deficit in GAMT KO hearts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109021-tenHove1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109021-Lygate4">[38]</xref>. However, if GA and creatine both share similar anti-oxidant activity, this could explain why GAMT KO hearts were similarly susceptible to ROS mediated dysfunction.</p>
<p>Nothing is known about the role of GA in myocardial oxidative stress, however, it has previously been shown that GA administration to rat striatum reduces antioxidant capacity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109021-Zugno1">[39]</xref>, arguing against a compensatory protective role from GA accumulation.</p>
<p>In our study we used mature mice (≥1 year) which are more representative of the age of patients with heart disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109021-NICE1">[40]</xref>, patients with anthracycline induced cardiomyopathy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109021-Cardinale1">[41]</xref> and in line with current recommendations to include older mice in pre-clinical studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109021-Hausenloy1">[42]</xref>. However, for pragmatic reasons this necessitated the use of both sexes, and we were careful to age- and sex- match groups throughout the study. Unfortunately, in one experimental group (doxorubicin-treated GAMT WT) we had insufficient mice of the appropriate genotype &gt;1 year old and therefore had to use mixed gender (n = 3 females n = 2 males) rather than an all male group. Cleary this is non-ideal, however, we firmly believe it is highly unlikely to affect the outcome of the study for a number of reasons. Firstly, there was no divergence in response when individual traces were plotted together. Furthermore, in contrast to other mammalian species, female mice have age-associated mitochondrial superoxide generation comparable to males <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109021-Ali1">[43]</xref>. In addition, although estrogen can protect female mice from ischaemia/reperfusion injury <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109021-Deschamps1">[44]</xref>, our three female mice are unlikely to benefit from estrogen-mediated cardioprotection since estrogen levels decline by 75% between 6 and 18 months <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109021-Sun1">[45]</xref>. Lastly, our study used retrograde <italic>ex-vivo</italic> Langendorff perfusion with crystalloid Krebs-Henseleit buffer and is therefore lacking in circulating hormones that may exert gender specific cardioprotection <italic>in-vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>Specifically, in our study we do not rule out that creatine may have a protective role against the gradual functional decline observed in chronic <italic>in</italic> <italic>vivo</italic> models of doxorubicin toxicity. There is a large body of evidence describing impaired cardiac energetics in response to doxorubicin dosing, including decreased PCr and ATP levels, inactivation of mitochondrial respiratory enzymes and altered substrate utilisation (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109021-TokarskaSchlattner5">[46]</xref> for comprehensive review).</p>
<p>Recent findings also show reduced creatine kinase (CK) activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109021-Streijger1">[47]</xref> and impaired creatine uptake capacity due to down-regulation of the creatine transporter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109021-Darrabie1">[48]</xref>. Most notably, genetic over-expression of the muscle isoform of CK in heart improved cardiac function and survival in a chronic mouse model of doxorubicin toxicity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109021-Gupta1">[49]</xref>. A reduction in plasma markers of cytotoxicity has also been observed with oral creatine supplementation in rats, although the effect on cardiac function was not reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0109021-Santos1">[50]</xref>. Clearly, it remains possible that increasing intracellular creatine levels might protect against anthracycline toxicity in long-term experiments <italic>via</italic> energetic mechanisms.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Using two genetic models of chronically altered myocardial creatine (supra-physiological elevation and zero-creatine) we have demonstrated that intracellular creatine content does not influence the detrimental effects of acute oxidative stress on cardiac function. This argues against creatine possessing significant antioxidant activity under acute pathological conditions in the intact beating heart.</p>
