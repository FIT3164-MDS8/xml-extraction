<abstract>
<p><italic>Giardia lamblia</italic> becomes dormant by differentiation into a water-resistant cyst that can infect a new host. Synthesis of three cyst wall proteins (CWPs) is the fundamental feature of this differentiation. Myeloid leukemia factor (MLF) proteins are involved in cell differentiation, and tumorigenesis in mammals, but little is known about its role in protozoan parasites. We developed a CRISPR/Cas9 system to understand the role of MLF in <italic>Giardia</italic>. Due to the tetraploid genome in two nuclei of <italic>Giardia</italic>, it could be hard to disrupt a gene completely in <italic>Giardia</italic>. We only generated knockdown but not knockout mutants. We found that knockdown of the <italic>mlf</italic> gene resulted in a significant decrease of <italic>cwp</italic> gene expression and cyst formation, suggesting a positive role of MLF in encystation. We further used <italic>mlf</italic> as a model gene to improve the system. The addition of an inhibitor for NHEJ, Scr7, or combining all cassettes for gRNA and Cas9 expression into one plasmid resulted in improved gene disruption efficiencies and a significant decrease in <italic>cwp</italic> gene expression. Our results provide insights into a positive role of MLF in inducing <italic>Giardia</italic> differentiation and a useful tool for studies in <italic>Giardia</italic>.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Giardia lamblia</italic> is a common cause of waterborne diarrhea due to contamination of water with human or animal feces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213594.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213594.ref002">2</xref>]. Although most cases have self-limiting diarrhea, a subset of patients may develop chronic giardiasis or irritable bowel syndrome after giardiasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213594.ref003">3</xref>]. Chronic giardiasis in children may lead to malnutrition and cognitive impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213594.ref004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213594.ref006">6</xref>]. <italic>Giardia</italic> can serve as a unique protozoan model for eukaryotic cell differentiation because its life cycle has been completed with the test tube [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213594.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213594.ref007">7</xref>]. Like many other organisms that adapt to inhospitable environments by persisting in a dormant state, <italic>G</italic>. <italic>lamblia</italic> undergoes differentiation from a pathogenic trophozoite form into a resistant infectious cyst form [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213594.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213594.ref008">8</xref>]. The cysts are protectively walled by cyst wall proteins (CWPs) and resistant to hypotonic lysis by fresh water and gastric acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213594.ref009">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213594.ref011">11</xref>]. Synthesis of at least two CWPs is coordinately induced during encystation, possibly by signaling molecules and transcription factors, including CDK2, MYB2, WRKY, PAX1, and E2F1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213594.ref012">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213594.ref016">16</xref>]. Histone modifications or epigenetic mechanisms may be involved in CWP expression and cyst formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213594.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213594.ref018">18</xref>].</p>
<p>Stable transfection systems that are involved in maintenance of episomal plasmids under drug selection, including neomycin and puromycin selection have been developed in <italic>Giardia</italic> for a stable and high expression of a target gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213594.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213594.ref020">20</xref>]. A system for knockout of a target gene in <italic>Giardia</italic> for studies of gene function is also needed. A Cre/loxP system has been developed for genetic manipulations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213594.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213594.ref022">22</xref>], but it is tedious to have a complete knockout in all alleles, because of a tetraploid genome in two nuclei of <italic>Giardia</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213594.ref023">23</xref>]. Although a virus-based antisense ribozyme or a dsRNA vector for mRNA knockdown has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213594.ref024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213594.ref025">25</xref>], they are not widely used. Morpholinos have been used to knockdown gene expression but they are very expensive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213594.ref026">26</xref>]. Development of a CRISPR/Cas9 system is in urgent need for studies of <italic>Giardia</italic>. A CRISPRi system with catalytically inactive Cas9 has been demonstrated for stable transcriptional repression of flagellar and ventral disc genes in <italic>Giardia</italic> recently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213594.ref027">27</xref>]. CRISPR/Cas9 systems have been developed in several protozoan parasites, including <italic>Plasmodium</italic>, <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>, <italic>Trypanosoma</italic>, <italic>Leishmania</italic>, and <italic>Trichomonas</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213594.ref028">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213594.ref032">32</xref>].</p>
<p>The type II CRISPR/Cas9 system is from <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> for defense against viral or plasmid DNA invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213594.ref033">33</xref>]. Cas9 can form a complex with gRNA to target DNA by recognizing a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM), which has NGG sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213594.ref034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213594.ref035">35</xref>]. After cleavage of DNA by Cas9/gRNA complex, dsDNA break will form (34, 35). To repair DNA break, cells may use an “error-prone” non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or an “error-free” homologous recombination (HR) pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213594.ref036">36</xref>]. NHEJ generates 1 to 10 bp insertion or deletion and subsequent frameshift mutations at the cleavage site, thereby introducing gene mutation or knockout [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213594.ref036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213594.ref037">37</xref>]. HR has lower frequency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213594.ref037">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213594.ref038">38</xref>], but enables error free targeted gene knockin. Knocking in of a DNA cassette allows introducing insertion of a drug resistance gene when an HR template cassette with two homology arms are present [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213594.ref037">37</xref>]. HR-dependent target gene replacement by knocking in of a drug resistant gene can lead to target gene disruption in the CRISPR/Cas9 system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213594.ref028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213594.ref037">37</xref>]. Scr7 has been used in mammalian cells to increase knock-in efficiency via CRISPR/Cas9-coupled HR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213594.ref039">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213594.ref040">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213594.ref041">41</xref>]. Scr7 inhibits NHEJ by blocking ligase IV mediated joining of dsDNA break and is shown to increase efficiency of precise genome editing by CRISPR/Cas9 in mammalian cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213594.ref040">40</xref>].</p>
<p>The myeloid leukemia factor (<italic>mlf</italic>) genes have been identified only in mammals and <italic>Drosophila</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213594.ref042">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213594.ref043">43</xref>], but not in yeast or plants. Human MLF1 is important for normal hemopoietic differentiation and its dysregulation may cause leukemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213594.ref042">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213594.ref044">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213594.ref045">45</xref>]. Human MLFs play a role in maintaining protein stability or in interacting with a secreted protein, secretagogin, or Cop9 signalosome, a proteasome-regulatory system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213594.ref043">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213594.ref046">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213594.ref047">47</xref>]. Little is known about the role of MLFs in mammals or in protozoan parasites. A MLF-like protein has been identified in the <italic>Giardia</italic> genome with a higher expression level during drug selection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213594.ref048">48</xref>]. The <italic>mlf</italic> gene is upregulated during encystation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213594.ref048">48</xref>], suggesting a demand for MLF protein increases during encystation. To date, no member of this gene family has been reported in protozoan parasites.</p>
<p>Since mammalian MLF proteins play critical roles in cell differentiation, we tried to understand the role of MLF in <italic>Giardia</italic> differentiation into cysts. We found that overexpression of MLF can increase the <italic>cwp1-3</italic> and <italic>myb2</italic> gene expression and cyst formation. We then developed a CRISPR/Cas9 system with two plasmids expressing Cas9 and gRNA separately. We found that knockdown of <italic>mlf</italic> gene by the CRISPR/Cas9 system resulted in a significant decrease of <italic>cwp</italic> gene expression and cyst formation. We used this first successful target gene, <italic>mlf</italic>, as a model to design an improved CRISPR/Cas9 system. We found that addition of Scr7, an inhibitor for NHEJ, resulted in a significantly improved gene disruption efficiency. In addition, the combination of all cassettes into one plasmid resulted in a further improved gene disruption efficiency. Our newly CRISPR/Cas9 system provides positive evidence of MLF in inducing <italic>Giardia</italic> differentiation into cysts and can be exploited to down regulate gene expression and study important functions of genes in <italic>G</italic>. <italic>lamblia</italic>.</p>

Encystation was performed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213594.ref011">11</xref>].

<title>MLF induced the expression of <italic>cwp1-3</italic> and <italic>myb2</italic> genes</title>
<p>Previous studies have shown that a gene encoding a MLF-like protein is up-regulated significantly during encystation and its gene promoter has the binding sites of the MYB2 transcription factor and is up-regulated by MYB2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213594.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213594.ref048">48</xref>], suggesting that MLF could be important for <italic>Giardia</italic> encystation. The deduced <italic>Giardia</italic> MLF protein contains 252 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of ~29.71 kDa and a pI of 6.81. It has one MLF1IP domain (residues 9 to 170) as predicted by Pfam (or residues or 59 to 170 by NCBI Conserved Domain Database) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0213594.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). The MLFIP domain can also be found in human MLF1 (residues 26 to 202), MLF2 (residues 10 to 199), and <italic>Drosophila</italic> MLF (residues 36 to 199). The <italic>Drosophila</italic> MLF1IP domain contains a 14-3-3 binding motif, which may involve in interaction with the transcription factor Dref [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213594.ref044">44</xref>], but the <italic>Giardia</italic> MLFIP domain has no 14-3-3 interaction motif, RSXSXPRXSXSX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213594.ref044">44</xref>]. Sequence alignment shows that <italic>Giardia</italic> MLF is moderately similar to the human MLF1 and MLF2 and <italic>Drosophila</italic> MLF (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0213594.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). The full-length of <italic>Giardia</italic> MLF has 12.69% identity and 24.63% similarity to that of human MLF1 (calculated from <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0213594.s001">S1 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>To determine the role of MLF protein, we prepared construct pPMLF, in which the <italic>mlf</italic> gene is controlled by its own promoter and contains an HA epitope tag at its C terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213594.g001">Fig 1A</xref>) and stably transfected it into <italic>Giardia</italic>. We first investigated the effect of MLF on cyst formation. In previous studies, we obtained consistent cyst number data from vegetative <italic>G</italic>. <italic>lamblia</italic> cultures during growth to stationary phase due to spontaneous differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213594.ref048">48</xref>]. In this study, we found that the cyst number in the MLF overexpressing cell line significantly increased relative to the control cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213594.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). MLF-HA protein was detected as a ~30kDa protein with anti-HA antibody, consistent with the predicted 30kDa molecular mass of MLF with the HA tag (1 kDa)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213594.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). Overexpression of MLF in the pPMLF cell line also can be confirmed by the anti-MLF antibody at a size of ~30 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213594.g001">Fig 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0213594.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). MLF overexpression resulted in a significant increase of the CWP1 and MYB2 protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213594.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). Quantitative real-time PCR and RT-PCR analysis showed that the mRNA levels of the endogenous <italic>mlf</italic> plus vector expressed <italic>mlf</italic> in the MLF overexpressing cell line significantly increased relative to the vector control cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213594.g001">Fig 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0213594.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). The levels of the <italic>cwp1-3</italic> and <italic>myb2</italic> mRNAs in the MLF overexpressing cell line also significantly increased relative to the vector control cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213594.g001">Fig 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0213594.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). Our results suggest that overexpression of MLF can induce expression of the <italic>cwp1-3</italic> and <italic>myb2</italic> genes and cyst formation. The MLF-HA was detected in unique localization in some unknown cytosolic vesicles, named MLF vesicles (MVs), during vegetative growth and encystation using anti-HA antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213594.g001">Fig 1E</xref>, also see below).

The sum of total cysts is expressed as relative expression level over control. Values are shown as means ± S. E. *, P &lt;0.05. (C) Overexpression of MLF increased the levels of CWP1 and MYB2 proteins. The 5’Δ5N-Pac and pPMLF stable transfectants were cultured in growth medium and then subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. The blot was probed with anti-HA, anti-MLF, anti-CWP1, anti-MYB2, and anti-RAN antibodies, respectively. Equal amounts of protein loading were confirmed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. A similar level of the RAN protein was detected. The intensity of bands from three Western blot assays was quantified using Image J. The ratio of each target protein over the loading control RAN is calculated. Fold change is calculated as the ratio of the difference between pPMLF cell line and the control cell line, to which a value of 1 was assigned. Results are expressed as mean ± SD. *P&lt;0.05.

The forward primer for PCR2 annealed to sequence upstream of the HR template of genomic DNA, but not inside the HR template, so PCR2 can detect the insertion of <italic>pac</italic> gene in genomic DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213594.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). We named this strategy as strategy 1. We also tried to use Scr7 to increase HR efficiency, named strategy 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213594.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). In strategy 3, an all-in-one plasmid system was established and tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213594.g002">Fig 2C</xref>).</p>

<title>Strategies 1 to 3 for MLF knock out.</title>
<p>(A) Strategy 1, diagrams of the pgCas9 and pMLFko plasmids. In construct pgCas9, the <italic>cas9</italic> gene is under the control of <italic>gdh</italic> promoter (striated box) and 3’ untranslated region of the <italic>ran</italic> gene (dotted box) and its product has a C-terminal nuclear localization signal (filled gray box) and an HA tag (filled black box). In construct pMLFko, a single gRNA is driven by the <italic>Giardia</italic> U6 promoter. The single gRNA includes a guide sequence targeting 20-nucleotides of the <italic>mlf</italic> gene (nt 115–134), which is located upstream three nucleotides of protospacer-adjacent motif (NGG sequence). pMLFko also has the HR template cassette which contains the 5’ and 3’ flanking region of the <italic>mlf</italic> gene as homologous arms and the <italic>pac</italic> selectable marker. The Cas9/gRNA cutting site in the genomic <italic>mlf</italic> gene is indicated by a red arrow. After introducing a double-stranded DNA break in the <italic>mlf</italic> gene, replacement of the genomic <italic>mlf</italic> gene with the <italic>pac</italic> gene will occur by HR. The pgCas9 and pMLFko constructs were transfected into <italic>G</italic>. <italic>lamblia</italic> WB trophozoites and MLFko stable transfectants were established under puromycin selection. The control cell line is trophozoites transfected with double amounts of 5’Δ5N-Pac plasmid and selected with puromycin. PCR1/2 were used for identification of knockout clones. Puromycin was removed from the MLFko and control cell lines to obtain the MLFko–pu and control–pu cell lines, respectively. (B) Strategy 2, diagrams of the pgCas9 and pMLFko plasmids, which are the same as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213594.g002">Fig 2A</xref>. These two constructs were transfected into trophozoites. An NHEJ inhibitor, SCR7, was added into the culture to increase HR. The MLFkoSC stable transfectants were established under puromycin selection. The control cell line is trophozoites transfected with double amounts of 5’Δ5N-Pac plasmid and selected with puromycin. (C) Strategy 3, diagrams of the pgCas9MLFko plasmid, which contains all the elements, including the expression cassettes of Cas9 and gRNA, and the HR template cassette which contains the 5’ and 3’ flanking region of the <italic>mlf</italic> gene as homologous arms and the <italic>pac</italic> selectable marker. After introducing a double-stranded DNA break in the <italic>mlf</italic> gene (red arrow), replacement of the genomic <italic>mlf</italic> gene with the <italic>pac</italic> gene will occur by HR. The pgCas9MLFko plasmid was transfected into trophozoites. An NHEJ inhibitor, SCR7, was added to increase HR. The Cas9MLFko stable transfectants were established under puromycin selection. The control cell line is trophozoites transfected with 5’Δ5N-Pac plasmid and selected with puromycin. In another experiment, puromycin was removed from the Cas9MLFko cell line to obtain the Cas9MLFko–pu cell line. The control cell line is wild type nontransfected WB trophozoites.</p>

<title>Incorporation of all cassettes into one plasmid increased gene disruption efficiency</title>
<p>We further tried to incorporate all three cassettes, including an HR template cassette, a Cas9 expression cassette, and a gRNA expression cassette, into one plasmid (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213594.g002">2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213594.g006">6</xref>, strategy 3).

<p>The replacement of the <italic>mlf</italic> gene with the <italic>pac</italic> gene in Cas9MLFko cell line was confirmed by PCR using PCR1 and PCR2 and sequencing analysis of genomic DNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0213594.s002">S2 Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213594.g006">Fig 6A</xref>).

The level of cyst formation significantly decreased in the Cas9MLFko cell line relative to the control cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213594.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). The levels of the MLF and CWP1 proteins and the levels of <italic>mlf</italic>, <italic>cwp1</italic>, or <italic>cwp2</italic> mRNAs significantly decreased in the Cas9MLFko cell line relative to the control cell line during vegetative growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213594.g006">Fig 6D and 6E</xref>). We can detect the expression of HA tagged Cas9 protein in the Cas9MLFko cell line but not in the control cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213594.g006">Fig 6D</xref>). We also found that gRNA can be detected by RT-PCR analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213594.g006">Fig 6F</xref>).

<title>Decrease of <italic>cwp1</italic>, <italic>cwp2</italic>, and <italic>myb2</italic> gene expression by MLF knock down during vegetative growth using strategy 3.</title>
<p>(A) Partial replacement of the <italic>mlf</italic> gene with the <italic>pac</italic> gene in the Cas9MLFko cell line confirmed by PCR. The pgCas9MLFko plasmid was transfected into trophozoites as described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213594.g002">Fig 2C</xref>. Genomic DNA was isolated from Cas9MLFko and control cell lines cultured in growth medium (vegetative growth, Veg). PCR was performed using primers specific for <italic>mlf</italic> (PCR1), <italic>pac</italic> (PCR2), <italic>cwp1</italic>, <italic>cwp2</italic>, and <italic>ran</italic> genes, respectively, as described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213594.g003">Fig 3A</xref>. (B) Partial disruption of the <italic>mlf</italic> gene in the Cas9MLFko cell line confirmed by real-time PCR. Real-time PCR was performed using genomic DNA and primers specific for <italic>mlf</italic>, <italic>cwp1</italic>, <italic>cwp2</italic>, and <italic>ran</italic> genes, respectively, as described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213594.g003">Fig 3A</xref>. (C) Cyst formation decreased by MLF knock down in the Cas9MLFko cell line. The control and Cas9MLFko cell lines were cultured in growth medium and then subjected to cyst count as described under “Material and Methods” and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213594.g001">Fig 1B</xref>. (D) Knock down of <italic>mlf</italic> gene decreased the levels of MLF and CWP1 proteins in the Cas9MLFko cell line. The control and Cas9MLFko cell lines were cultured in growth medium and then subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis as described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213594.g001">Fig 1C</xref>. The blot was probed with anti-HA, anti-MLF, anti-CWP1, and anti-RAN antibodies, respectively. The intensity of bands from three Western blot assays was quantified using Image J. The ratio of each target protein over the loading control RAN is calculated. Fold change is calculated as the ratio of the difference between Cas9MLFko cell line and the control cell line, to which a value of 1 was assigned. Results are expressed as mean ± SD. *P&lt;0.05.

The control and Cas9MLFko cell lines were cultured in growth medium and then subjected to RT-PCR analysis using primers specific for gRNA, and 18S ribosomal RNA genes, respectively. Similar levels of the 18S ribosomal RNA were detected. (G) Localization of Cas9-HA to the nuclei and cytoplasm in the Cas9MLFko cell line. The control and Cas9MLFko cell lines were cultured in growth medium and then subjected to immunofluorescence analysis using anti-HA antibody for detection. Cas9-HA localized to the nuclei and cytoplasm in the Cas9MLFko cell line but no signal was detected in the control cell line. The left panel shows that the Cas9-HA protein is localized to the nuclei and cytoplasm, but no signal was detected in the control cell line. The middle panel shows the DAPI staining of cell nuclei.

<p>We also obtained two clonal populations using single cell dilution method (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0213594.s010">S10 Fig</xref>). The results from PCR and quantitative real-time PCR show a successful disruption of the <italic>mlf</italic> gene by about 73% or 78% and a partial replacement of the <italic>mlf</italic> gene with the <italic>pac</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0213594.s010">S10 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>We also did two gRNA controls using the same all-in one plasmid system with gRNA 1 or 2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0213594.s011">S11 Fig</xref>). The gRNA 1 targets a different region of the <italic>mlf</italic> gene (nt 61–80) as compared with strategy 1 (nt 115–134) (also see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0213594.s014">S1 Table</xref>). We found a successful disruption of the <italic>mlf</italic> gene by about 46% and a partial replacement of the <italic>mlf</italic> gene with the <italic>pac</italic> gene in gRNA control 1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0213594.s011">S11 Fig</xref>), suggesting that the second gRNA also worked. The levels of the MLF and CWP1 proteins obviously decrease in the gRNA control 1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0213594.s011">S11 Fig</xref>). The gRNA 2, which targets 20 mers of G, is a negative gRNA control (also see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0213594.s014">S1 Table</xref>). However, there was no replacement or mutation of the <italic>mlf</italic> gene in gRNA control 2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0213594.s011">S11 Fig</xref>), suggesting that the negative gRNA can not function in gene disruption. The levels of the MLF and CWP1 proteins did not change in the gRNA control 2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0213594.s011">S11 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>We further tried to analyze results without puromycin. After selection, puromycin was removed from the Cas9MLFko cell line to obtain the Cas9MLFko -pu cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213594.g002">Fig 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0213594.s012">S12 Fig</xref>). The control cell line is wild type nontransfected WB trophozoites. The results from quantitative real-time PCR show a successful disruption of the <italic>mlf</italic> gene by about 69% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0213594.s012">S12 Fig</xref>).The level of cyst formation significantly decreased in the Cas9MLFko–pu cell line relative to the control cell line (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0213594.s012">S12 Fig</xref>). The levels of the MLF and CWP1 proteins and the levels of <italic>mlf</italic>, <italic>cwp1</italic>, or <italic>cwp2</italic> mRNAs obviously decreased in the Cas9MLFko–pu cell line relative to the control cell line during vegetative growth (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0213594.s012">S12 Fig</xref>). We did not detect the expression of HA tagged Cas9 protein in the Cas9MLFko -pu cell line or the control -pu cell line, possibly due to the removal of puromycin and loss of the plasmid (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0213594.s012">S12 Fig</xref>). Similar results were obtained from the Cas9MLFko–pu cell line during encystation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0213594.s013">S13 Fig</xref>). The results suggest a decrease of encystation related gene expression and cyst formation by knockdown of <italic>mlf</italic> gene using strategy 3 without puromycin.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The protozoan <italic>G</italic>. <italic>lamblia</italic> that can form cysts to survive in the environment and to infect hosts, is a unique model diverging from the commonly studied eukaryotes. Studies in <italic>Giardia</italic> provide information for biology of the unicellular eukaryote, particularly of regulation of cell differentiation. Establishment and application of gene knockout systems are important works for studies of this organism. We have developed a CRISPR/Cas9 system to disrupt <italic>mlf</italic> gene using two plasmids to express Cas9 and gRNA (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213594.g002">2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213594.g003">3</xref>, strategy 1). The disruption of <italic>mlf</italic> gene can be achieved by partial replacement of the <italic>mlf</italic> gene with the <italic>pac</italic> gene by HR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213594.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). To further improve the disruption efficiency, we added Scr7, an NHEJ inhibitor, to increase HR, and found an increase of the disruption efficiency on <italic>mlf</italic> gene from about 32% to about 53%, compared with the system without Scr7 (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213594.g002">2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213594.g003">3B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0213594.s006">S6 Fig</xref>, strategy 2). Scr7 also worked in mammalian cells to increase knock-in efficiency via CRISPR/Cas9-coupled HR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213594.ref039">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213594.ref040">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213594.ref041">41</xref>]. Canonical NHEJ works by DNA ligase IV and XRCC mediated joining of dsDNA break [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213594.ref040">40</xref>]. Alternative NHEJ works by DNA ligase I/III [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213594.ref040">40</xref>]. We only found one DNA ligase gene (open reading frame 7649) with low homology to ligase IV and III. Since Scr7 can inhibit DNA ligase IV, and also DNA ligase III [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213594.ref040">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213594.ref058">58</xref>], it is possible that Scr7 can target Giardia DNA ligase. This awaits future work to explore. A XRCC-like gene was found from <italic>Giardia</italic> genome database (open reading frame 6918) but also with very low homology. Scr7 may inhibit <italic>Giardia</italic> DNA repair since Scr7 can inhibit <italic>Giardia</italic> growth (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0213594.s006">S6 Fig</xref>). In addition, Scr7 can increase gene disruption efficiency in our system, suggesting that <italic>Giardia</italic> may have an unusual NHEJ pathway which still can be inhibited by Scr7. The importance of NHEJ for eukaryotic genome stability also suggests the presence of NHEJ in <italic>Giardia</italic>, which awaits further studies to clarify [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213594.ref059">59</xref>].</p>

<title>MLF increases and induces cyst formation during encystation.</title>
<p>(A) Disruption of the <italic>mlf</italic> gene by CRISPR/Cas9 system. A single gRNA includes a guide sequence targets the 20-nucleotides of the <italic>mlf</italic> gene which is located upstream three nucleotides of protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM, NGG sequence). An HR template cassette contains the 5’ and 3’ flanking region of the <italic>mlf</italic> gene as homologous arms and the <italic>pac</italic> selectable marker. Cas9 can form a complex with gRNA to target DNA by recognizing PAM sequence. After cleavage of DNA by Cas9/gRNA complex, dsDNA break will form and then replacement of the genomic <italic>mlf</italic> gene with the <italic>pac</italic> gene will occur by HR. (B) Increase of encystation-induced pathway during encystation. The gene encoding key components of the cyst wall, <italic>cwp1</italic>, is up-regulated by MYB2, WRKY, and PAX1 transcription factors during encystation. These transcription factors can bind to AT-rich initiator (Inr) of the <italic>cwp1</italic> promoter. They can also activate <italic>mlf</italic> gene expression. The increase of MLF also can increase the levels of CWP1, MYB2, WRKY, PAX1, and CDK2. MLF was present in vegetative trophozoite stage at a lower level. During encystation, more MLF is produced by these transcription factors. MLF may further induce encystation by increasing this encystation-induced pathway in <italic>Giardia</italic>. The increase of transcription factors may further induce CWP1 and MLF expression, resulting in more cyst formation during encystation.</p>

<p>Transfection studies for gene expression have been used to investigate gene function in <italic>Giardia</italic>. A transient DNA transfection system employed a <italic>gdh</italic> promoter to drive a luciferase gene, which expressed transiently and only lasted for one day after transfection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213594.ref056">56</xref>]. Stable transfection is more useful than transient transfection due to relatively long time and higher expression levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213594.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213594.ref020">20</xref>]. In our two-plasmid-CRISPR/Cas9 system, we used a transient transfection system to express the Cas9 protein, which was tagged with a C-terminal nuclear localization signal (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213594.g002">2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213594.g003">3</xref>, strategy 1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213594.ref060">60</xref>]. We were not able to detect the expression of Cas9 protein by Western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213594.g003">Fig 3E</xref>), possibly due to low amounts of Cas9 expressed from the transient transfection system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213594.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213594.ref056">56</xref>]. The successful results for MLF knockdown suggest that a little amount of the transiently expressed Cas9 is enough for its function after transfection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213594.ref056">56</xref>]. We also tried to express Cas9 using stable transfection of an all-in-one plasmid in <italic>Giardia</italic> (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213594.g002">2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213594.g006">6</xref>, strategy 3), although it has been reported that stably expressed Cas9 is toxic to <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213594.ref061">61</xref>]. The all-in-one plasmid system was predicted to stably express Cas9 and a gRNA targeting the <italic>mlf</italic> gene, as we were able to detect the stably expressed Cas9 protein by Western blot and immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213594.g006">Fig 6D and 6G</xref>) and found an increase of disruption efficiency on <italic>mlf</italic> gene from about 53% to about 70% as compared with the two-plasmid system (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213594.g002">2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213594.g007">7B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0213594.s006">S6 Fig</xref>, strategy 3). We can detect the expressed Cas9 in both nuclei and cytoplasm in the all-in one plasmid system with the best gene disruption efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213594.g006">Fig 6G</xref>), suggesting that partial localization of Cas9 to the nuclei is still functional. It was reported that Cas9 did not successfully enter nuclei using the <monospace>HASKKKRKVAPKKKRKVDKKYSIGL</monospace> sequence as a nuclear localization signal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213594.ref022">22</xref>]. We used KKKRKV as the nuclear localization signal, which is shorter and can target tetracycline repressor to the nuclei in our tetracycline inducible system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213594.ref060">60</xref>]. We tried to avoid the potential off-target effect by searching the NCBI Nucleotide database with our designed guide sequence. Reduction of Cas9 expression is also a way to reduce the off-target effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213594.ref062">62</xref>]. Our strategy 1 with transient expression of Cas9 provides a limited expression of Cas9 (see above).</p>
<p>In our two-plasmid system, we transfected a plasmid form of the HR template cassette that can be maintained by stable transfection using puromycin selection, allowing successfully introducing insertion of the <italic>pac</italic> drug resistance gene (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213594.g002">2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213594.g003">3</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0213594.s006">S6 Fig</xref>, strategy 1). We found a similar gene disruption efficiency on <italic>mlf</italic> gene and protein and mRNA expression whether the results were measured from the time immediately after selection or 1 month after selection. This suggests a relatively long and stable system. In the case of the plasmid form of the HR template with stable transfection, subsequent analysis was performed after removal of puromycin for a month to avoid the interference of plasmids and puromycin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213594.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213594.ref048">48</xref>]. We found that the plasmid was not present after removal of puromycin for 1 month. Similarly, it has been found that the plasmid was not present after removal of G418 for 6 weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213594.ref022">22</xref>].</p>
<p>Insertion of a whole plasmid, including the vector sequence to <italic>Giardia</italic> can be achieved by transfection of linear plasmid cut by restriction enzyme and drug selection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213594.ref063">63</xref>]. In our study, gene replacement is achieved using circular plasmid and results in insertion of only the HR template fragment without the vector sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213594.g002">Fig 2A</xref>, strategy 1). We also found that the process is gRNA dependent (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0213594.s011">S11 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>We did two gRNA controls with Cas9 and HR template in the all-in one system (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0213594.s011">S11 Fig</xref>). We found a successful disruption of the <italic>mlf</italic> gene in the gRNA control 1, which targets a different region of the <italic>mlf</italic> gene (nt 61–80) as compared with strategy 1 (nt 115–134) (also see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0213594.s014">S1 Table</xref>), suggesting that the second gRNA also worked. However, there was no mutation of the <italic>mlf</italic> gene in gRNA control 2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0213594.s011">S11 Fig</xref>), which has 20 mers of C as guide sequence targeting 20 mers of G, suggesting that the negative gRNA can not target the <italic>mlf</italic> genes. In addition, gRNA can be detected in the successful all-in-one system, suggesting that it was functional (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213594.g006">Fig 6F</xref>). We also found that the process is Cas9 dependent (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0213594.s008">S8 Fig</xref>). There was no mutation of <italic>mlf</italic> gene in the No-Cas9 control (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0213594.s008">S8 Fig</xref>), which lacks Cas9 but has gRNA and HR template as compared with strategy 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213594.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). These results suggest that Cas9 is essential for the CRISPR/Cas9 system. We also found that the process is HR template dependent (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0213594.s008">S8 Fig</xref>). There was no mutation of the <italic>mlf</italic> gene in the No-HR-template control (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0213594.s008">S8 Fig</xref>), which lacks HR template, but has Cas9 and gRNA as compared with strategy 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213594.g002">Fig 2A</xref>), suggesting that targeting the <italic>mlf</italic> gene using puromycin selection has more efficiency. The presence of Cas9 and gRNA did not result in NHEJ, possibly due to low expression of transiently expressed Cas9 and gRNA (see above). We also performed single cell dilution for the all-in-one plasmid system and found that the obtained two clonal populations have a similar disruption efficiency of 73% and 78% as compared with their original cultures (70%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213594.g006">Fig 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0213594.s010">S10 Fig</xref>), suggesting homogeneity of the original population. A Cre/loxP system allows persistence of gene disruption in the absence of drug selection in <italic>Giardia</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213594.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213594.ref022">22</xref>]. It is interesting to compare the CRISPR/Cas9 and Cre-lox systems in <italic>Giardia</italic>.</p>
<p>Because of tetraploid genome and two nuclei, it could be hard to disrupt a gene completely in <italic>Giardia</italic>. To date, we can only knockdown <italic>mlf</italic> gene expression, but not complete knockout <italic>mlf</italic> gene. The best gene disruption efficiency we obtained is about 70% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213594.g006">Fig 6</xref>, strategy 3). Because puromycin had been added during selection, it is not possible to for the cells to preform HR by one more round of transfection and puromycin selection. The examples of successful knockout of target genes in other organisms suggest the potential of CRISPR/Cas9 to knockout genes in <italic>Giardia</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213594.ref028">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213594.ref032">32</xref>]. The potential of the CRISPR/Cas9 system to complete knockout genes of interest in <italic>Giardia</italic> awaits further studies to explore. Using a strong promoter to drive the expression of <italic>cas9</italic> gene could improve knockout efficiency. Our CRISPR/Cas9 system still provides a valuable tool for partial replacement of an essential gene for gene disruption in <italic>Giardia</italic> studies. It has been known that viability is low in <italic>Drosophila</italic> MLF null mutant embryo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213594.ref064">64</xref>]. The success of MLF knockdown with our CRISPR/Cas9 system could be due to that MLF is a nonessential gene for <italic>Giardia</italic> growth. This is correlated with what we found that the major function of MLF is inducing encystation. To date, we do not know if the complete knockout of MLF may lead to death of <italic>Giardia</italic>. The confirmation that <italic>mlf</italic> gene is essential (death) or nonessential (growth) requires successful knockout of <italic>mlf</italic> gene. A complete knockout of an essential gene may lead to cell death, so it is hard to determine the gene function for that case. We have tried to knockdown 12 genes, including <italic>mlf</italic> by our CRISPR/Cas9 system, but only have obtained successful growth of 4 mutant cell lines after gene disruption under drug selection. We only generated the knockdown but not knockout mutants for these 4 genes. It is possible that the other 8 genes whose mutants cannot be obtained could be essential genes. Combining the CRISPR/Cas9 system and tetracycline inducible system can allow an adjustable knockdown of a target gene in the future [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213594.ref060">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213594.ref065">65</xref>].</p>
<p>Three genes encoding key components of the cyst wall, cyst wall proteins, are highly expressed during <italic>Giardia</italic> differentiation into dormant cysts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213594.ref009">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213594.ref011">11</xref>]. It has been found that transcription factors MYB2, WRKY, and PAX1 can bind to specific promoter sequences and up-regulate the <italic>cwp1-3</italic> genes during encystation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213594.g007">Fig 7B</xref>)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213594.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213594.ref015">15</xref>]. In addition, CDK2 is upstream of MYB2 by phosphorylation and activation of MYB2, leading to upregulation of <italic>cwp1-3</italic> genes during encystation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213594.ref012">12</xref>]. The <italic>myb2</italic>, <italic>wrky</italic>, <italic>pax1</italic>, and <italic>cdk2</italic> genes are also all up-regulated during encystation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213594.ref012">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213594.ref015">15</xref>]. Interestingly, during encystation, <italic>mlf</italic> gene is also up-regulated, suggesting a demand and a positive role of MLF in encystation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213594.ref048">48</xref>]. We found that overexpression of MLF can induce the expression of <italic>cwp1-3</italic> and <italic>myb2</italic> genes and cyst formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213594.g001">Fig 1</xref>). We developed a CRISPR/Cas9 system for <italic>mlf</italic> knockout studies in <italic>Giardia</italic>, but only obtained knockdown results. Knockdown of <italic>mlf</italic> gene led to a decrease of the MLF protein level and the number of MVs (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213594.g003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213594.g004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213594.g005">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213594.g006">6</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0213594.s009">S9 Fig</xref>). Knockdown of <italic>mlf</italic> gene also led to a decrease in the levels of CWP1, MYB2, WRKY, PAX1, and CDK2 proteins and <italic>cwp1-3</italic>, <italic>myb2</italic>, <italic>wrky</italic>, <italic>pax1</italic>, and <italic>cdk2</italic> gene expression and cyst formation (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213594.g003">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213594.g005">5</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0213594.s009">S9 Fig</xref>), suggesting a positive role of MLF in inducing <italic>cwp1-3</italic>, <italic>myb2</italic>, <italic>wrky</italic>, <italic>pax1</italic> and <italic>cdk2</italic> genes and cyst formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213594.g007">Fig 7A and 7B</xref>). Because <italic>Giardia</italic> MLF localized to cytosolic MVs and it was not a nuclear protein, it is possible that MLF induced <italic>cwp1-3</italic> gene expression indirectly. MLF may upregulate MYB2, WRKY, PAX1 or CDK2, which have been known to induce <italic>cwp1-3</italic> gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213594.ref012">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213594.ref015">15</xref>], which then induces <italic>cwp1-3</italic> gene expression. Our knockdown studies suggest that regulation of CWP1, MYB2, WRKY, PAX1 or CDK2 protein levels by MLF could be critical for <italic>Giardia</italic> encystation. We also found that the <italic>mlf</italic> gene expression is activated by MYB2 and its gene promoter has the binding sites of MYB2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213594.ref013">13</xref>], suggesting a positive regulation cycle between MLF and MYB2. Human MLFs are important for normal hemopoietic differentiation and play a role in maintaining protein stability or in interacting with a secreted protein or a proteasome-regulatory system, but the specific role of human MLFs is not known [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213594.ref042">42</xref>– <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213594.ref047">47</xref>]. Role of MLF in <italic>Giardia</italic> MVs may be related to metabolism of unfolded mutant proteins, which await further studies to explore. Studies suggest that MLF is present in the membrane vesicles for mitosomes isolation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213594.ref066">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213594.ref067">67</xref>]. However, detailed localization of MLF in mitosomes or some other vesicles awaits further study.</p>
<p>In this study, we have developed a CRISPR/Cas9 system in <italic>G</italic>. <italic>lamblia</italic>. This system could be used to disrupt a gene of interest for studying its roles in cell physiology and in cell differentiation, such as encystation or excystation. Such a system will also be useful to study the function of different proteins in a specific pathway <italic>in vivo</italic>. Our results also indicate that MLF can induce the expression of the <italic>cwp</italic> genes that are involved in differentiation in the primitive protozoan <italic>G</italic>. <italic>lamblia</italic>, suggesting that MLF may be functionally conserved and involved in cell differentiation. Our study leads to greater understanding of the evolution of eukaryotes during cell differentiation and help develop ways to interrupt the parasite life cycle.</p>
