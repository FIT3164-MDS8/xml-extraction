<abstract>
<p>Dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are suggested to modulate immune function, but the effects of dietary fatty acids composition on gene expression patterns in immune organs have not been fully characterized. In the current study we investigated how dietary fatty acids composition affects the total transcriptome profile, and especially, immune related genes in two immune organs, spleen (SPL) and bone marrow cells (BMC). Four tissues with metabolic function, skeletal muscle (SKM), white adipose tissue (WAT), brown adipose tissue (BAT), and liver (LIV), were investigated as a comparison. Following 8 weeks on low fat diet (LFD), high fat diet (HFD) rich in saturated fatty acids (HFD-S), or HFD rich in PUFA (HFD-P), tissue transcriptomics were analyzed by microarray and metabolic health assessed by fasting blood glucose level, HOMA-IR index, oral glucose tolerance test as well as quantification of crown-like structures in WAT. HFD-P corrected the metabolic phenotype induced by HFD-S. Interestingly, SKM and BMC were relatively inert to the diets, whereas the two adipose tissues (WAT and BAT) were mainly affected by HFD <italic>per se</italic> (both HFD-S and HFD-P). In particular, WAT gene expression was driven closer to that of the immune organs SPL and BMC by HFDs. The LIV exhibited different responses to both of the HFDs. Surprisingly, the spleen showed a major response to HFD-P (82 genes differed from LFD, mostly immune genes), while it was not affected at all by HFD-S (0 genes differed from LFD). In conclusion, the quantity and composition of dietary fatty acids affected the transcriptome in distinct manners in different organs. Remarkably, dietary PUFA, but not saturated fat, prompted a specific regulation of immune related genes in the spleen, opening the possibility that PUFA can regulate immune function by influencing gene expression in this organ.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Fatty acids are a heterogeneous group of macronutrients that can be divided into saturated fatty acids (SFA), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). It has been shown that these three types of fat affect the body and the immune system differently, especially in the pathological inflammatory responses associated with metabolic disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155099.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155099.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155099.ref003">3</xref>].</p>
<p>Previously, low fat diets (LFDs) were widely recommended to maintain a healthy body weight. Current dietary recommendations are however less focused on the amount of fat and more on the fatty acid composition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155099.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155099.ref005">5</xref>]. Interestingly, in several observational studies, the amount of dietary fat has only been associated with minor or negligible effects on cardiometabolic diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases and type-2 diabetes mellitus, while the dietary fatty acid composition appears to be more important [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155099.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155099.ref006">6</xref>].</p>
<p>SFA are typically categorized as unhealthy, partly because they contribute to low-grade chronic inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155099.ref001">1</xref>]. For example, it has been shown that replacing the energy from SFA with the equivalent energy from unsaturated fatty acids reduces the risk of developing coronary heart disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155099.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155099.ref006">6</xref>].</p>
<p>PUFA are mainly divided into omega-3 (ω-3 PUFA) and omega-6 fatty acids (ω-6 PUFA). ω-3 PUFA are regarded as anti-inflammatory, whereas ω-6 PUFA, especially arachidonic acid, are essentially regarded as pro-inflammatory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155099.ref003">3</xref>]. Recently, we showed that the dietary fatty acid composition greatly affected the survival of mice subjected to <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic>-induced sepsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155099.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155099.ref008">8</xref>]. Mice fed high fat diet (HFD) rich in SFA (HFD-S) had decreased survival and increased bacterial load compared with mice fed HFD rich in PUFA (HFD-P). Neutrophils are of major importance for early defense against bacterial infections. Therefore, the difference in survival between mice fed HFD-S and HFD-P was attributed to an increase in neutrophil frequency in the bone marrow from mice fed HFD-P prior to the infection.</p>
<p>To better understand the potential benefits of dietary fatty acid composition, it is important to understand the underlying mechanisms of the different diets. Several studies have investigated the dietary effect on the transcriptome profile of single tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155099.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155099.ref010">10</xref>]. However, the number of studies investigating and comparing the transcriptome profile in several metabolic and immune-related organs, using the same analysis strategy for all tissues, is limited. In the present study, we investigated how the fatty acid composition affected the total transcriptome profile, and especially the immune related genes, in the immune organs spleen (SPL) and bone marrow cells (BMC). Since PUFA has major effects on metabolic tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155099.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155099.ref012">12</xref>] we also included metabolic organs; skeletal muscle (SKM), white adipose tissue (WAT), brown adipose tissue (BAT), and liver (LIV), to be able to compare the gene expression pattern in both immune and metabolic tissues.</p>

<p>Six-week old, male, C57BL/6 mice were obtained from Harlan Netherlands B.V. (Horst, The Netherlands). The mice were housed under standard conditions of light and temperature at the animal facility of the Laboratory for Experimental Biomedicine at University of Gothenburg, Sweden. Water and food were provided <italic>ad libitum</italic>. At the age of 7 weeks, the mice were randomized into one of the following diets: LFD (D12450B, 3.9 kcal/g, 10 kcal% fat, 20 kcal% protein, 70% carbohydrate, Research Diets, New Brunswick, NJ, USA); HFD-S (D12492, 5.2 kcal/g, 60 kcal% fat, 20 kcal% protein, 20 kcal% carbohydrate, Research Diets) and HFD-P (D09020505; same composition as HFD-S of fat, protein, and carbohydrate, but 69% of the lard was exchanged for menhaden oil; Research Diets). The (ω-6 PUFAs)/(ω-3 PUFAs) ratio was 14.2 (29.9/2.1) in HFD-S, 0.6 (16.2/25.6) in HFD-P and 8.2 (42.4/5.2) in LFD (LFD had, however, considerably less total fat compared with the two HFDs). The diets were matched to have similar macronutrient sources except for the fat. The composition of the diets is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0155099.t001">Table 1</xref>.</p>

We define this group of GO-terms as “immune system GO-terms”. Piano was used for performing gene-set analysis of these immune system GO-terms, excluding gene-sets with less than 10 or more than 500 genes. The p-values for the gene-sets were adjusted for multiple testing using the method of Benjamini and Hochberg and are referred to as q-values. The heatmap in Fig 3 is based on significant GO-terms (q&lt;0.05 in at least one comparison) according to the so called non-directional class in piano.

<title>Random Forest classification</title>
<p>The random forest classification was carried out in R using the random Forest package. Each sample was classified as belonging to either cluster 1 or 2 based on a model trained on the remaining samples (leave-one-out cross-validation). During the training of each model (one per sample), the importance of individual probe sets for the classification were extracted. The importance was given by a score called the mean decrease in Gini index (Gini coefficient). The top 200 important probe sets (defined by having the highest average Gini coefficients) were used in a GO-term (all Biological Processes) overrepresentation analysis (hypergeometric test using piano). To find the top 12 most important genes for classification, the classification procedure was repeated 100 times, i.e. the class of each sample was predicted 100 times based on 100 different models/sample. The average Gini coefficient over all repeated runs could then be used to rank the genes by importance more robustly than from 1 run.</p>

The most dramatic effect of HFD-P on tissue transcriptomics was observed in spleen, an immune tissue. Remarkably, the spleen was barely affected at all by HFD-S compared with LFD.

Secondly, both WAT/HFDs samples (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>.

It is also apparent in SPL, the HFD-P samples separated from the LFD and HFD-S. These observations suggest that diet effects on tissue transcriptomes were mainly observed in WAT and SPL, influenced by HFD <italic>per se</italic> in the former and by HFD-P specifically in the latter. (B) A hierarchical tree of the samples was constructed based on the same genes used in the PCA plot.

<p>In order to further explore these interesting patterns, a hierarchical clustering of the samples was performed based on the same selection of data as described above for the PCA plot. The hierarchical tree shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0155099.g002">Fig 2B</xref> separated the samples in two main clusters: Cluster 1 consisting of the SKM, BAT and LIV samples, and cluster 2 consisting of the BMC and SPL samples. In agreement with the PCA plot, the WAT samples were separated between these two clusters: The WAT/LFD samples in cluster 1, together with the metabolic tissues, and the WAT/HFD-P and WAT/HFD-S samples, together with the immune-related tissues, in cluster 2. This suggests that HFDs, regardless of the fatty acid composition, causes transcriptional changes in WAT that are similar to the transcriptional patterns of the immune organs BMC and SPL. In addition to the PCA plot, a clear HFD-P effect on the SPL transcriptome was also observed by the hierarchical clustering, albeit not as dramatic as the separation of the WAT samples.</p>

Interestingly, the effect of dietary fatty acids in SPL differed from that of the other tissues. In SPL, HFD-S had a similar effect as LFD, whereas HFD-P induced a transcriptional pattern distinct from the other two diets. Thus, the specific fatty acid composition of HFD-P, rather than the increase in fat amount, seemed to be the main triggering factor for the transcriptional changes in SPL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0155099.g003">Fig 3</xref>). The affected genes were mostly involved in the adaptive immune system, and to a lesser extent, in the innate immune system and erythrocyte control.

As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0155099.g003">Fig 3</xref> the major effects on immune related GO terms in WAT are by both the HFDs, regardless of fatty acid composition. In general, HFDs up-regulated both the innate and the adaptive immune system (HFD-P <italic>vs</italic>. LFD and in HFD-S <italic>vs</italic>. LFD). However, HFDs also down-regulated specific GO-terms related to interferon mediated signaling, including both type I and type II interferon (HFD-P <italic>vs</italic>. LFD and HFD-S <italic>vs</italic>. LFD). In addition, HFD-P also down-regulated T cell differentiation compared with mice fed LFD (HFD-P <italic>vs</italic>. LFD).

LFD or HFD-S <italic>vs</italic>. LFD. The heatmap can help to identify if there is a characteristic gene expression pattern across tissues that distinguish the two main clusters. For example, a subset of genes that shows a particularly high expression levels in the samples of cluster 2 when compared with cluster 1. It is clear from the heatmap that there is a specific set of genes that were responsible for the similarity between the WAT/HFDs, SPL and BMC samples.</p>

In this process each gene is scored based on its influence on classification.

<p>To further characterize the HFD-regulated genes in WAT causing the separation between the two clusters, we performed sample classification using supervised learning (random forests model). Briefly, the expression signals of the genes in the heatmap (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. HFDs-regulated genes in WAT) were used as input to the classification model so that each sample was predicted to belong to either cluster 1 or 2. This enabled us to identify the genes that were most important for classification of the two clusters thus driving the separation of the WAT samples. The importance scores are depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0155099.g004">Fig 4B</xref> (sorted by decreasing importance) showing that roughly 200 genes had high impact on the classification into the two clusters, whereas the remaining roughly 600 genes had little importance. In order to identify the general biological functions these 200 genes represent, we performed a GO-term (all Biological Processes) overrepresentation analysis, using the hypergeometric test. The most significantly enriched (<italic>q</italic>&lt;0.05) functions are presented in the lower box. These were to a large extent represented by immune-related processes and out of these 200 genes, 54 belonged to the cluster of genes marked in the heatmap in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0155099.g004">Fig 4A</xref>. The upper box contains the top 12 genes (in terms of classification importance) and can be seen as drivers of the separation of the WAT samples. Since the individual importance scores of the top 200 genes are quite similar, the list of the top 12 genes was estimated by repeating the classification described above 100 times.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we investigated the transcriptome profiles of six different tissues after an 8 week feeding period, where the mice had been fed LFD, HFD-S or HFD-P. We demonstrated that dietary PUFA suppressed expression of immune related genes in spleen, whereas there were negligible effects of HFD-S compared with LFD. In addition, regardless of fat composition, HFD <italic>per se</italic> induced a specific gene expression profile in WAT compared with LFD. Further, HFD-P corrected the metabolic phenotype induced by HFD-S. These results are of interest in relation to our previous findings from this experimental model where the total amount and the dietary fatty acid composition affected immune function as well survival in septic infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155099.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155099.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155099.ref024">24</xref>].</p>
<sec id="sec029">
<title>Dietary fat composition affected the transcriptome of SPL but not BMC</title>
<p>The present results clearly show that dietary SFA and PUFA differently affected the transcriptome of SPL, a well-recognized immune organ. Surprisingly, this effect was more dramatic than the SFA and PUFA effects on the LIV, SKM, WAT and BAT transcriptomes, all recognized as primarily metabolic organs. This finding is well in line with our previous reports showing that the dietary fatty acid composition can greatly influence the immune system, including its capacity to clear certain bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155099.ref007">7</xref>]. Moreover, the immune capacity to clear bacteria may be lower in mice fed HFD-S than in those fed LFD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155099.ref024">24</xref>].</p>
<p>The mechanism by which PUFA, and especially ω-3 PUFA can affect the immune system is not clear. One possibility is that ω-3 PUFA acts directly, by decreasing the content of arachidonic acid, the precursor of pro-inflammatory eicosanoids, or by being the precursor of resolvins, some anti-inflammatory fatty acid derivatives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155099.ref003">3</xref>]. ω-3 PUFA may also act by altering transcription factor activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155099.ref003">3</xref>]. Further, PUFA in the cell membrane may increase plasma membrane fluidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155099.ref025">25</xref>], and thereby improve the phagocytosis capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155099.ref026">26</xref>].</p>
<p>The two immunological tissues included in the current analysis (BMC and SPL) displayed clearly differentiated response to the diets. While gene expression in BMC was barely affected at all, there was a significant effect on SPL in mice fed HFD-P, but not in those fed HFD-S. The lack of dietary effects in the BMC was surprising, but it should be noted that the cut-off for significant difference was set rather high (<italic>q</italic>&lt;0.001). We have previously reported that mice fed HFD-P have a higher frequency of neutrophils in the bone marrow at an uninfected state and show a better immune response during an <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic>-induced sepsis compared with mice fed HFD-S [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155099.ref007">7</xref>].</p>
<p>In SPL, HFD-P affected gene expression related to both the innate and the adaptive immune system. Interestingly, according to the GO classification, both arms of the immune system, innate and adaptive immune system, were down-regulated in SPL from mice fed HFD-P compared with mice fed HFD-S and LFD. This is in line with the previously reported anti-inflammatory responses mediated by PUFA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155099.ref027">27</xref>].</p>
<p>Genes associated to erythrocyte control were up-regulated in SPL from mice fed HFD-P compared with mice fed HFD-S and LFD. However, the erythrocyte concentration in the blood did not differ between the groups (data not shown). This differentially expression of genes regulating erythrocyte development and differentiation may reflect an increased turnover without affecting their concentration in blood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155099.ref028">28</xref>].</p>

<title>HFDs induced an immunological phenotype in WAT</title>
<p>The primary purpose of white adipose tissue is energy storage; however, in the hierarchical clustering analysis, the WAT from mice fed HFDs clustered with the immunological tissues BMC and SPL. Hence, in mice fed HFDs, WAT developed an immunological phenotype. This is in line with previous work showing that hypertrophied WAT secretes pro-inflammatory agents promoting systematic inflammation, and that there is macrophage recruitment to WAT in obese individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155099.ref029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155099.ref030">30</xref>]. Indeed, in the current study WAT from mice fed HFD-S had higher gene expression of macrophage marker <italic>Adgre1</italic> (F4/80), as well as the M1 markers <italic>Cd40</italic> (CD40) and <italic>Ccl2</italic> (MCP-1), compared with mice fed LFD. This was further supported by the increase in CLS in WAT from mice fed HFD-S. Interestingly, despite the similar weight of the visceral WAT in mice fed HFD-S as in mice fed HFD-P, mice fed HFD-P did not have increased macrophage markers or CLS. Additionally, mice fed HFD-P had lower HOMA-IR index and OGTT AUC compared with mice fed HFD-S. These findings confirm previous data that adipose tissue inflammation is prevented by dietary PUFA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155099.ref012">12</xref>], as found in HFD-P, and that dietary PUFA can improve glucose homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155099.ref031">31</xref>].</p>
<p>The general consensus has been that inflammation in white adipose tissue is deleterious and contributes to the metabolic syndrome. However, it was recently suggested that in order to maintain a healthy adipose tissue expansion and remodeling, a local acute adipocyte inflammation is crucial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155099.ref032">32</xref>]. Adipose tissue expansion and remodeling is critical for protecting against deposition of lipids in other tissues, such as the liver. Indeed, in the current study we detected liver lipid deposition in mice fed HFD-S, but not in mice fed HFD-P. Hence, this indicates that PUFA maintain the expansion and remodeling of WAT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155099.ref033">33</xref>].</p>

<title>Immunological effects in LIV by HFDs</title>
<p>Besides the major role in metabolic regulation, the liver also has an important immunological role [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155099.ref034">34</xref>]. Indeed, LIV was affected by the two different HFDs in specific ways. Both HFDs led to a down-regulation of the immune system GO-terms, but the number of suppressed GO-terms was higher for mice fed HFD-P compared with mice fed HFD-S. Further, HFD-P down-regulated several GO-terms involved in immune responses, suggesting an anti-inflammatory effect of HFD-P in the liver. ORO staining showed that the LIV from all groups (LFD, HFD-P, and HFD-S) had lipid droplets in the hepatocytes; however, the lipid droplets were clearly larger and more numerous in mice fed HFD-S, confirming previous publications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155099.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155099.ref035">35</xref>]. The present results are also in line with earlier studies showing that HFD-P favorably can affect lipid metabolism in the liver and decrease lipid deposits in this organ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155099.ref036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155099.ref037">37</xref>].</p>

When this tissue becomes insulin resistant this will contribute to the development of the metabolic syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155099.ref038">38</xref>]. There are several suggested mechanisms behind the reduced insulin signaling and intramuscular lipid accumulation is one of them. HFD-S may increase intramuscular lipid accumulation, whereas HFD-P can reverse this effect by influencing the expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155099.ref039">39</xref>]. In the current study, SKM (gastrocnemius) was surprisingly inert to the dietary changes in terms of immune related GO-terms, <italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. none of the immune related GO-terms were affected by the dietary changes.</p>

<title>Dietary fatty acids affect the transcription factor NFκB</title>
<p>Both SFA and PUFA have indirect effects on the immune system by influencing the activity of transcription factors. For example, SFA and ω-3 PUFA affect NFκB in opposite ways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155099.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155099.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155099.ref041">41</xref>]. NFκB is a major transcription factor regulating the transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines, like interleukin 1-beta, interleukin-6, interferon-γ, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, and tumor necrosis factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155099.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155099.ref042">42</xref>]. ω-3 PUFA decrease endotoxin-induces activation of NFκB in monocytes and macrophages whereas SFA has the opposite effect and enhances NFκB activation in macrophages in white adipose tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155099.ref001">1</xref>] and immune cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155099.ref041">41</xref>]. Indeed, in the current study NFκB was influenced by HFD-P compared with HFD-S in WAT, SPL and LIV, as shown by the general down-regulation of NFκB target genes induced by HFD-P. This could also explain the higher expression of M1 macrophage markers <italic>Cd40 and Ccl2</italic> in WAT from mice fed HFD-S compared with both mice fed HFD-P and LFD. Another transcript factor that has been reported to be affected in opposite directions by SFA and PUFA is peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155099.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155099.ref043">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0155099.ref044">44</xref>].
