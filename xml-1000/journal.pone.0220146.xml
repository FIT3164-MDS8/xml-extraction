<abstract>
<p>Microvascular proliferation (MVP), an aberrant vascular structure containing multilayered mitotically active endothelial- and smooth-muscle cells/pericytes, is a histopathological hallmark of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Although MVP tends to be associated with high-grade glioma, it has also been detected in WHO grade I pilocytic astrocytoma (PA). However, little is known about the mechanism underlying its formation. Using TP53 point mutations as a marker for tumor-derived cells, we earlier reported that MVP was partially converted from tumor cells via mesenchymal transition. In the current study we used the KIAA1549-BRAF fusion gene as a marker to assess whether MVPs in PA contained tumor-derived cells and/or phenotypically distinct tumor cells expressing vascular markers. cDNA synthesized from frozen tissue of six PA patients operated at our institute was analyzed to detect the KIAA1549-BRAF fusion gene by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. The breakpoint in the fusion gene was identified by long and accurate PCR (LA-PCR) and Sanger sequencing of genomic DNA. Distinct tumor cells and cellular components of MVP were obtained by laser microdissection. For the qualitative and quantitative detection of the KIAA1549-BRAF fusion gene we performed genomic and digital PCR assays. Fluorescence <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (FISH) was used to assess gene fusion in cellular components of MVP. Samples from three PA patients harbored the KIAA1549 exon 15, BRAF exon 9 fusion gene. In two patient samples with abundant MVP, RT-PCR assay detected strong bands arising from the KIAA1549-BRAF fusion gene in both tumor cells and cellular components of MVP. Digital PCR showed that vis-à-vis tumor tissue, its relative expression in cellular components of MVP was 42% in one- and 76% in another sample. FISH revealed amplified signals in both tumor cells and cellular components of MVP indicative of tandem duplication. Our findings suggest that in patients with PA, some cellular components of MVP contained tumor derived cell and/or phenotypically distinct tumor cells expressing vascular markers.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Gliomas, the most common type of brain tumors, are characterized by their infiltrative growth and high vascularity. Among them, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most aggressive and lethal. It is most highly neovascularized and contains vascular structures, i.e. areas of microvascular proliferation (MVP), that are complex structures composed of both proliferating endothelial and smooth-muscle cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0220146.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0220146.ref004">4</xref>]. MVP is abundant in areas adjacent to necrosis and at the edge of tumor invasion where rapidly proliferating tumor cells increase the demand for oxygen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0220146.ref005">5</xref>]. Consequently, vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A), induced by HIF1α and hypoxia, is thought to be the most important mediator for assembling these special vascular structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0220146.ref006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0220146.ref007">7</xref>]. In randomized phase III trials of bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody against human VEGF-A, the overall survival time of patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma was not significantly increased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0220146.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0220146.ref009">9</xref>]. Recent work indicated that vascular endothelial cells derived from tumor-initiating cells play an important role in resistance to anti-VEGF therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0220146.ref010">10</xref>].</p>
<p>Glioma stem-like cells (GSCs) can transdifferentiate into vascular endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0220146.ref010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0220146.ref012">12</xref>]. It was shown that endothelial cells in GBM surgical samples carried the same genomic alteration as tumor cells, and GSCs characterized as CD133-positive could develop into endothelial cells. We also showed that cellular components of MVP in GBM harbored the same p53 mutation as surrounding tumor cells as analyzed by immunostaining and Sanger sequencing with the laser microdissection method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0220146.ref013">13</xref>]. These findings suggested that tumor neovascularization in GBM was partially achieved via endothelial differentiation of GSCs. Additionally, it has been reported that tumor derived endothelial cells showed resistance to anti-VEGF therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0220146.ref010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0220146.ref012">12</xref>]. As aberrant vascular structures and chemoresistant phenotypes may be strongly involved in gliomas, treatments that target tumor-derived endothelial cells may overcome their resistance to anti-VEGF therapies.</p>
<p>Although MVP is generally a hallmark of GBM and is characteristic in high-grade glioma, it was observed in pilocytic astrocytoma (PA), a grade I astrocytoma. PA is a circumscribed, slow-growing tumor that includes abundant MVP comprised of so-called ‘glomeruloid’ vessels that form complex structures composed of both proliferating endothelial- and smooth-muscle cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0220146.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0220146.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0220146.ref015">15</xref>]. Although some studies showed that the expression of VEGF was similar in PA and GBM, and was considered to elicit MVP in PA, very little is known [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0220146.ref016">16</xref>]. And same as GBM, MVP in PA is also considered as the candidate therapeutic target. Anti-VEGF therapies have been used to treat PA patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0220146.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0220146.ref018">18</xref>]. In some adults with recurrent PA unresponsive to conventional therapy, bevacizumab was efficacious, however, in pediatric glioma patients, bevacizumab and irinotecan showed no effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0220146.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0220146.ref018">18</xref>]. Resistance to anti-VEGF therapies must be overcome in PA patients. To develop anti-angiogenic strategies for their treatment, the mechanisms underlying neovascularization in PA must be identified.</p>
<p>In the present study, we investigated the possibility that MVPs in PA, as in GBM, harbor tumor derived endothelial cells and/or phenotypically distinct tumor cells expressing vascular markers. The KIAA1549-BRAF fusion gene, resulting from duplication of the BRAF gene at 7q34, is used as a marker of tumor derived cells and phenotypically distinct tumor cells expressing vascular markers; it is the most frequent genetic alteration in PA (&gt;70%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0220146.ref019">19</xref>]. To evaluate whether cellular components of MVP in PA harbor the KIAA1549-BRAF fusion, tumor samples from patients treated at our institution were analyzed by Sanger sequencing for breakpoints. With primers designed around the breakpoint, the presence of the KIAA1549-BRAF fusion in cellular components of MVP, strictly collected by laser microdissection methodology, were qualitatively and quantitatively evaluated by genomic and digital PCR, respectively. FISH analysis was also employed to detect KIAA1549-BRAF fusion.</p>

<title>cDNA synthesis and genomic DNA extraction</title>
<p>Total RNA was extracted from frozen tumor tissues using the Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Reverse transcription was with SuperScript VILO cDNA Synthesis Master Mix (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions in a thermal cycler at 25°C for 10 min, followed by 42°C for 60 min, 85°C for 5 min, and cooling to 4°C.</p>
<p>Genomic DNA was isolated from frozen tissues using the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen). To obtain micro-dissected samples we used paraffin-embedded sections and the QIAamp DNA Micro Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. cDNA and genomic DNA samples were stored at -20°C until analysis.</p>

<title>Collection of tumor and MVP constituent cells</title>
<p>Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue was cut into 2-μm-thick sections, mounted on membrane slides (1.0 PEN NF, Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany), and stained with hematoxylin and eosin for the detection of MVP. We identified glomeruloid vessels as MVP. Tumor samples were micro-dissected with a laser under a PALM Micro Beam Laser Capture Microdissection microscope (Carl Zeiss); dissected samples were collected with Adhesive Cap 500 Clear (Carl Zeiss).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>New insight of the mechanism of GBM neovascularization that GSCs could transdifferentiate into vascular endothelial cells was much impressive not only for one of the mechanisms of the resistance of anti- VEGF therapies but for the interaction of GSCs with vascular compartments took part in the microenvironment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0220146.ref010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0220146.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0220146.ref020">20</xref>]. By contrast, little is known about neovascularization, vascular niche, and the existence of GSCs in PA. In this study, we evaluated whether vascular endothelial cells of PA contained tumor derived cells and/or phenotypically distinct tumor cells expressing vascular markers. This is the first report considering the origin of MVP in PA, and our results might shed light on the microenvironment in low-grade glioma.</p>
<p>To analyze samples harvested by laser microdissection from FFPE slides, we first identified the accurate breakpoint in each sample. Although three fusion-positive samples exhibited the same fusion pattern (KIAA1549 exon 15, BRAF exon 9), the breakpoints were different. Lawson et al. also reported that the breakpoint of each samples was totally different in their analysis of 43 low-grade astrocytoma patients, and these fusions could be categorized into three groups: “seamless transition,” “presence of short inserted,” and “breakpoint microhomology.” This terminology is based on the sequence alignment of the fusion breakpoint [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0220146.ref021">21</xref>]. In our fusion positive samples, S6 showed a continuous transition from KIAA1549 intron 15 to BRAF intron 8 and, thus, was categorized as “seamless transition” (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0220146.s003">S3 Fig</xref>), S1 showed the 7 bp inserted sequence at the breakpoint and categorized as “presence of short inserted” (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0220146.s005">S5 Fig</xref>), and S4 showed the shared 3 bp sequence between the end of KIAA1549 and the beginning of BRAF and categorized as “breakpoint microhomology” (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0220146.s007">S7 Fig</xref>). We think that these results document the accuracy of our method for detecting breakpoints.</p>
<p>Our result showed that the ratio of cells harboring the KIAA1549-BRAF fusion gene in cellular components of MVP to tumor cells was different from S1 (42%) to S6 (76%). Soda et al. also showed a difference among GBM samples in the rate of endothelial cells derived from tumor cells (2.0–37.8%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0220146.ref010">10</xref>]. They suggested that the observed rate variation was attributable to the location of the analyzed endothelial cells in the tumor, or to the tumor size <italic>per se</italic>. At present, we cannot rule out sampling bias due to the heterogeneity of our tumor cells and of the cellular components of MVP. We are collecting more samples to identify factors responsible for the inter-sample difference in the rate of cellular components of MVP that harbor the KIAA1549-BRAF fusion gene in patients with PA.</p>
<p>In this study, we demonstrated that MVP in PA contained tumor derived cell and/or phenotypically distinct tumor cells expressing vascular markers by analyzing the presence of the KIAA-BRAF fusion gene via PCR and FISH methods. In GBM, Vitiani et al. demonstrated that GSCs cultured in endothelial condition medium could generate progeny with the phenotypic and functional features of endothelial cells, resulting in tube formation and CD31 expression. GSCs injected into mice produced tumor xenografts, the vessels of which were composed primarily of human endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0220146.ref011">11</xref>]. However, in PA, it is difficult to perform such in vitro and in vivo experiments because there are currently no methods for selecting and culturing GSCs from these tumors. Additionally, we also have no commercially available cell lines of PA. Thus, it will be critical to establish such methods to handle GSCs in PA and perform such verification experiments in the future.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>We provide evidence that MVP in PA might contain tumor derived cell and/or phenotypically distinct tumor cells expressing vascular markers. Our work sheds light on not only the resistance of PA to anti-VEGF therapies but also on the microenvironment in low-grade glioma.</p>
