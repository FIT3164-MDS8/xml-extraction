        <p>Two RNAs (4.5SH and 4.5SI) with unknown functions share a number of features: short length (about 100 nt), transcription by RNA polymerase III, predominately nuclear localization, the presence in various tissues, and relatively narrow taxonomic distribution (4 and 3 rodent families, respectively). It was reported that 4.5SH RNA turns over rapidly, whereas 4.5SI RNA is stable in the cell, but their lifetimes remained unknown. We showed that 4.5SH is indeed short-lived (t<sub>1/2</sub>∼18 min) and 4.5SI is long-lived (t<sub>1/2</sub>∼22 h) in Krebs ascites carcinoma cells. The RNA structures specifying rapid or slow decay of different small cellular RNAs remain unstudied. We searched for RNA structural features that determine the short lifetime of 4.5SH in comparison with the long lifetime of 4.5SI RNA. The sequences of genes of 4.5SH and 4.5SI RNAs were altered and human cells (HeLa) were transfected with these genes. The decay rate of the original and altered RNAs was measured. The complementarity of 16-nt end regions of 4.5SI RNA proved to contribute to its stability in cells, whereas the lack of such complementarity in 4.5SH RNA caused its rapid decay. Possible mechanisms of the phenomenon are discussed.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Most types of RNA in mammalian cells are stable: their lifetime is estimated at hours or even days. However, some mRNAs are short-lived and their half-life (t<sub>1/2</sub>) is estimated at minutes. Short lifetime of such mRNAs is due to the need to quickly change the cellular level of proteins encoded by them (e.g., factors regulating cell cycle and proliferation). The rapid degradation is usually due to the presence of AU-rich elements in mRNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044157-Chen1">[1]</xref>. Mechanism and regulation of such mRNA degradation have been studied rather well <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044157-Mukherjee1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044157-Franks1">[3]</xref>. At the same time, the degradation of small RNAs, except for tRNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044157-Chernyakov1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044157-Wilusz1">[5]</xref> and microRNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044157-Bail1">[6]</xref>, remains unexplored.</p>
      <p>Mammalian small RNAs (70–300 nt) were discovered in the 70 s of the last century <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044157-Weinberg1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044157-Zieve1">[9]</xref>. It gradually became clear that they play an important role in pre-mRNA splicing (U1, U2, U4, U5, U6, U11, and U12 RNAs), pre-rRNA processing (U3 and U14 RNAs) and modification (C/D box RNAs and H/ACA box RNAs), as well as protein secretion (7SL RNA), transcription regulation (7SK RNA), and the initiation of DNA replication (Y RNAs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044157-MakarovaIu1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044157-Krude1">[14]</xref>. In contrast to these RNAs that are apparently ubiquitous for all eukaryotes, there are small RNAs with a relatively narrow range of distribution (stenoRNAs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044157-Gogolevskaya1">[15]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The most studied among them is BC1 RNA that is synthesized by RNA polymerase III (pol III) in the nervous tissue and testes of (presumably) all rodents, but not other mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044157-DeChiara1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044157-Martignetti1">[17]</xref>. Usually, the genome has a single BC1 gene, which is a master gene of ID <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044157-Kim1">[18]</xref>, a repetitive DNA sequence belonging to short interspersed elements (SINEs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044157-Kramerov1">[19]</xref>. BC1 RNA was shown to repress translation of certain mRNAs in dendrites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044157-Lin1">[20]</xref>. BC200 RNA has a similar function in humans and, likely, other higher primates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044157-Lin1">[20]</xref>, although it originated from FLAM-C, the ancient monomeric Alu SINE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044157-Martignetti2">[21]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The two RNAs studied here, also belong to the stenoRNA group. 4.5SI RNA is present in rodents of only three related families: Muridae (mice, rats, gerbils), Cricetidae (hamsters, voles), and Spalacidae (mole rats, root rats, zokors) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044157-Gogolevskaya1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044157-Gogolevskaya2">[22]</xref>. Tissues of the same rodents, as well as jerboas and birch mice (Dipodidae), contain 4.5SH RNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044157-Gogolevskaya3">[23]</xref>. These RNAs have similar length (4.5SI, 98–101 nt and 4.5SH, 94 nt) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044157-Gogolevskaya1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044157-RoChoi2">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044157-Harada1">[25]</xref> and are localized predominately in the nucleus. In mouse, 4.5SI is transcribed from three genes located on chromosome 6 and spaced 40 kb apart <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044157-Gogolevskaya4">[26]</xref>. The number of 4.5SH genes is much higher (700–800) in genomes of all rodents studied; each 4.5SH gene is a part of a 4–5 kb tandemly repeated unit <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044157-Gogolevskaya3">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044157-Schoeniger1">[27]</xref>. The both of RNAs are evolutionarily related to SINEs: 4.5SI RNA genes seemed to originate from SINE B2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044157-Serdobova1">[28]</xref>, whereas 4.5SH RNA genes were derived from a copy of an ancient SINE pB1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044157-Quentin1">[29]</xref>. Genes of these RNAs, as well as SINEs, are transcribed by pol III due to an internal promoter composed of two parts (boxes A and B), while 5′-flanking sequences also influence transcription of these genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044157-Gogolevskaya4">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044157-Koval1">[30]</xref>. The function of both RNAs remains unknown, although an association of 4.5SH RNA with poly(A)-containing RNAs was shown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044157-Schoeniger1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044157-Harada2">[31]</xref>. Contrary to most of mammalian small RNAs, 4.5SH RNA has a rapid turnover in mouse cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044157-Schoeniger1">[27]</xref>. Here we constructed chimeric 4.5SH/4.5SI RNAs, as well as modified sequences of the two RNAs by other ways, and showed that the complementarity of end regions of 4.5SI RNA contributes to its stability in cells, whereas the lack of such complementarity in 4.5SH RNA causes its rapid decay.</p>

        <title>Study of structural features determining the lifetime of 4.5SH and 4.5SI RNA</title>
        <p>One can suggest that peculiarities of structure determine the difference in stability between 4.5SH and 4.5SI RNAs in the cell. To examine this hypothesis, we created plasmid constructs containing chimeric genes of 4.5SH and 4.5SI RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044157-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). The transcription of such genes resulted in the formation of 4.5SH RNA molecules in which some parts were replaced by the corresponding regions of 4.5SI RNA. HeLa cells (human carcinoma) were transfected with the plasmid constructs obtained, and in 20 h, the half-life of the synthesized RNA was evaluated using the treatment of cells with actinomycin D. Natural and chimeric 4.5SH/4.5SI RNAs were detected by Northern hybridization in total RNA preparations isolated in different periods of time following administration of actinomycin D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044157-g004">Fig.4A, B</xref>). The results show that the deletion of 3′end region (construct <italic>B</italic>), as well as the replacement of 3′ end (construct <italic>C</italic>), 5′ end (construct <italic>D</italic>) or central (construct <italic>E</italic>) regions of 4.5SH RNA with corresponding regions of 4.5SI RNA did not significantly change the stability of these RNAs, in comparison with natural 4.5SH RNA (construct <italic>A</italic>). However, the simultaneous replacement of 3′ and 5′ end regions in 4.5SH RNA (construct <italic>F</italic>) by the corresponding regions of 4.5SI RNA essentially increased the lifetime of the chimeric RNA. Its half-life was estimated as 2 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044157-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>).</p>

        <p>These data allowed us to put forward two hypotheses. According to the first one, the stability of 4.5SI RNA is determined by its interaction with proteins recognizing the specific nucleotide sequences at 5′ and 3′ ends of this RNA. The second hypothesis is based on the prediction of secondary structures of the natural and chimeric 4.5SH/4.5SI RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044157-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). We suggested that 4.5SI RNA stability is due to the complementary interaction between 5′ and 3′ end regions of this RNA, which results in formation of long (16 pb) double-helical stem. Such complementary interaction between the termini is absent in 4.5SH RNA and all chimeric RNAs, except for RNA transcribed from the construct <italic>F</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044157-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). To choose between these two hypotheses, we made an additional construct that contained 4.5SH RNA gene with 13 nucleotide substitutions at the 3′ end region; due to these substitutions the 3′ region became complementary to the 5′ region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044157-g003">Figs. 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044157-g005">5</xref>, construct <italic>G</italic>). The half-life of the RNA obtained was estimated as 2 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044157-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). This result conforms with the second hypothesis, i.e. it is the complementarity between RNA end regions that increases its lifetime in the cell.</p>

        <p>Thus, the secondary structure (rather than the nucleotide sequence of 5′ and 3′ ends) is crucial for stability of 4.5SI RNA in the cell. Short lifetime of 4.5SH RNA is a result of the lack of the complementarity between its end regions, whereas other mechanisms seem not to be involved in stabilizing this RNA in the cell.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>4.5SH RNA belongs to the rare type of small RNAs that is characterized by short lifetime (t<sub>1/2</sub>∼18 min in KAC cells). In human, chimpanzee, and gorilla (but not in other primates), a 117 nt RNA, SnaR (small NF90-associated RNA), was found <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044157-Parrott1">[32]</xref>. Half-life of the RNA is 15 min <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044157-Parrott2">[33]</xref>. SnaR genes derived from Alu-related SINEs seem to have originated from 7SL RNA. These features of SnaR resemble those of 4.5SH RNA (its genes are the derivatives of SINE pB1, and also originated from 7SL RNA). Thus, primates SnaR and rodent 4.5SH appeared as a result of parallel evolution. However, in contrast to 4.5SH RNA, SnaR is expressed at high levels only in the testis, whereas in other organs its content is very low or moderate (brain). A fraction of SnaR is associated with ribosomes or polysomes, which can point to the involvement of this RNA in the translation control <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044157-Parrott2">[33]</xref>. We, however, did not observe the association of 4.5SH RNA with polysomes (K. Tatosyan and D. Kramerov, unpublished data).</p>
      <p>Pol III transcripts of SINEs (that are unable for polyadenylation) are also short-lived small RNAs. Pol III transcripts of murine SINE B2 without a polyadenylation signal (<named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">AAUAAA</named-content>) are rapidly degraded in the cell (t<sub>1/2</sub>∼40 min), whereas polyadenylated B2 transcripts are stable <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044157-Borodulina1">[34]</xref>. Most likely, poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) protects poly(A)-containing SINE RNA from degradation by 3′endonucleases.</p>
      <p>One can expect that other short-lived small RNAs will be found. Difficulty in their discovery can be related to low copy numbers of such RNAs in the cell. Despite the short lifetime of 4.5SH RNA, the number of its molecules in the cell is rather large (13,000), apparently due to the large number (700–800) of genes encoding this RNA in the mouse genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044157-Schoeniger1">[27]</xref>. However, the number of genes of other short-lived small RNAs can be much smaller, which can result in very small number of molecules of the small RNAs in the cell (see as example mouse MEN β tRNA-like small RNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044157-Wilusz1">[5]</xref>). Interestingly, by depleting RNA degradation machinery, Preker and coworkers found so called promoter upstream transcripts (PROMPTs) that are various, low-copy, non-coding, and very rapidly decaying RNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044157-Preker1">[35]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Here we searched for RNA structural features which determine the short lifetime of 4.5SH, as compared with the lifetime of 4.5SI RNA (t<sub>1/2</sub>∼22 h). These RNAs demonstrate a number of similar traits: length, synthesis by pol III, predominately nuclear localization, the presence in various tissues, relatively narrow taxonomic distribution, and the evolutionary relationship with SINEs. <italic>A priori</italic> the great difference between lifetimes can be due to the difference of nucleotide sequences of these two RNAs. For example, 4.5SH RNA could contain degradation signals, much as short-lived mRNAs carry AU-rich elements. On the other hand, 4.5SI RNA could contain nucleotide sequences that can specifically bind proteins preventing rapid degradation of the RNA.</p>
      <p>We found that replacing the nucleotide sequences of 4.5SH RNA with the corresponding regions of 4.5SI RNA did not significantly increase the lifetime of the chimeric 4.5SH RNA. These results argue against the hypothesis that the primary structure of some regions determines the lifetime of these two RNAs. On the other hand, the simultaneous replacement of 22 nt at 5′ end and 12 nt at 3′ end (construct F) increased the RNA lifetime by 6-fold. According to the secondary structure prediction, this double replacement results in the formation of a double-helical stem (16 bp with a single mismatch) that includes both termini of the RNA. A similar double-helical stem (but without the mismatch) can be predicted for 4.5SI RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044157-g005">Fig. 5<italic>H</italic></xref>). We suggested that such stem formed by RNA termini increases lifetime of RNA. To test it, the 15-nt region at 3′ end of 4.5SH RNA was replaced by the sequence complementary to 5′ end of this RNA (construct <italic>G</italic>). It was found that the lifetime of this RNA is also 6-fold longer than that of the original 4.5SH RNA. This result proves that it is the complementarity of the ends of the RNA, rather than primary structure per se, that increases the lifetime of the RNA.</p>
      <p>A question may arise: why in these experiments, the lifetime of RNA is increased by 6 times (t<sub>1/2</sub>∼2 h), and not many times more? Perhaps, other elements of secondary structure (in addition to 16-bp stem) also contribute to the long lifetime of 4.5SI RNA. In other words, probably only the entire secondary structure of genuine 4.5SI RNA ensures its long lifetime (t<sub>1/2</sub>∼22 h). One can speculate that some proteins recognize the RNA shape formed by its secondary structure and prevent its decay. However, this complex issue remains unexplored. At the same time, by changing 11-nt end regions to mutually complementary sequences, we clearly showed the importance of complementarity of ends in determination of 4.5SI RNA lifetime. The change of just one end (constructs <italic>I</italic> and <italic>J</italic>) resulted in drastic decrease of the lifetime of the modified 4.5SI RNA (t<sub>1/2</sub>∼20 min), whereas the replacement of both ends preserved the RNA stability at the level similar to that of native 4.5SI RNA.</p>
      <p>Here we have not studied the secondary structure of RNA by enzymatic methods. There are no reports on the enzymatic study of 4.5SI RNA folding. We believe that this lack of knowledge is not very significant in the context of this study: computer prediction of the secondary structure of this RNA is quite reliable as it contains a long (16 bp) perfect stem (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044157-g005">Fig. 5</xref>, construct <italic>H</italic>). Labuda and Zietkiewicz <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044157-Labuda1">[36]</xref> studied the secondary structure of 4.5SH RNA using enzymatic methods, however, they encountered some difficulties. On one hand, these authors revealed the same two hairpins that are present in the predicted structure of 5′ half of this RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044157-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>). On the other hand, contradictory results were obtained for 3′ half of 4.5SH RNA: the same sites were often cut by both single-strand- and double-strand-specific nucleases. It was interpreted as the coexistence of many conformational forms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044157-Labuda1">[36]</xref>. Thus, 4.5SH RNA does not have long perfect hairpins and its secondary structure is very dynamic.</p>
      <p>The way of RNA stabilization described here is not ubiquitous, as many small RNAs have no double-helical stem formed by complementary interaction between end regions. For example, BC1 RNA is quite stable but does not demonstrate the complementarity between two end regions; on the contrary, this RNA has long and short stem-loop structures at 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044157-Rozhdestvensky1">[37]</xref>. Additionally, BC1 RNA contains a long A-rich region located immediately upstream of 3′-stem; PABP can bind this region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044157-Muddashetty1">[38]</xref> and contribute to stability of BC1 RNA in cells. On the other hand, 7–12 bp stems formed by complementary interaction between 5′ and 3′ end regions are present in tRNAs, 5S rRNA, Y1-5 RNAs etc. A single nucleotide mismatch in the acceptor stem dramatically reduces the level of the tRNA in mouse cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044157-Wilusz1">[5]</xref>. Thus, the 7 bp-acceptor (end) stem is a possible factor of tRNA stability in cells. It was found that two CCA trinucleotides were synthesized at the 3′ end of tRNA with the single nucleotide mismatch, and such modification resulted in a rapid decay of the RNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044157-Wilusz1">[5]</xref>. It seems unlikely that the same mechanism is involved in the rapid decay of 4.5SH RNA because: (i) posttranscriptional CCA addition is specific for tRNA and tRNA-like transcripts; (ii) cDNA sequencing revealed no CCA trinucleotides at 3′-end of 4.5SH RNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044157-Gogolevskaya3">[23]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The mechanism of stabilization of small RNAs by formation of end stem remains unclear. One can suggest that such a double-helical structure protects RNA from exonucleases (e.g. Xrn1) and exosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044157-LykkeAndersen1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044157-Jones1">[40]</xref>. Perhaps, proteins binding to long double-helical stems are also involved in the prolongation of small RNA lifetime. There are a number of proteins with various functions that can specifically bind to double-stranded RNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044157-FierroMonti1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044157-Saunders1">[42]</xref>. These issues can be studied using the system of short- and long-lived RNAs that was described by us.</p>
