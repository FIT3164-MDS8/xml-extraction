<title>Background</title>
<p>Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the most common type of renal cancer. One of the processes disturbed in this cancer type is alternative splicing, although phenomena underlying these disturbances remain unknown. Alternative splicing consists of selective removal of introns and joining of residual exons of the primary transcript, to produce mRNA molecules of different sequence. Splicing aberrations may lead to tumoral transformation due to synthesis of impaired splice variants with oncogenic potential. In this paper we hypothesized that disturbed alternative splicing in ccRCC may result from improper expression of splicing factors, mediators of splicing reactions.</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title>
<p>Using real-time PCR and Western-blot analysis we analyzed expression of seven splicing factors belonging to SR proteins family (SF2/ASF, SC35, SRp20, SRp75, SRp40, SRp55 and 9G8), and one non-SR factor, hnRNP A1 (heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1) in 38 pairs of tumor-control ccRCC samples. Moreover, we analyzed splicing patterns of five genes involved in carcinogenesis and partially regulated by analyzed splicing factors: RON, CEACAM1, Rac1, Caspase-9, and GLI1.</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>Conclusions/Significance</title>
<p>We found that the mRNA expression of splicing factors was disturbed in tumors when compared to paired controls, similarly as levels of SF2/ASF and hnRNP A1 proteins. The correlation coefficients between expression levels of specific splicing factors were increased in tumor samples. Moreover, alternative splicing of five analyzed genes was also disturbed in ccRCC samples and splicing pattern of two of them, Caspase-9 and CEACAM1 correlated with expression of SF2/ASF in tumors. We conclude that disturbed expression of splicing factors in ccRCC may possibly lead to impaired alternative splicing of genes regulating tumor growth and this way contribute to the process of carcinogenesis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most common solid lesion of the kidney and represents ∼3% of all human malignancies. Each year in Europe about 40 000 new cases of RCC are diagnosed and approximately 20 000 patients die of the disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013690-Schffski1">[1]</xref>. The vast majority (80%) of RCC cases are histologically classified as clear cell renal cell carcinomas (ccRCC), originating from proximal tubules of the kidney. The molecular basis of ccRCC is not fully understood. Although several molecular markers have been proposed, neither of them has been approved for routine clinical use <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013690-Ljungberg1">[2]</xref>.</p>
<p>One of the cellular processes, often disturbed in cancers, is alternative splicing, the process of selective removal of introns and joining of residual exons, in which mRNA molecules of various sequences are produced. Aberrant alternative splicing may lead to tumoral transformation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013690-Fackenthal1">[3]</xref>. Impaired alternative splicing of several genes was also reported in ccRCC. For instance, in our previous work we found ccRCC-specific imbalanced expression of type 1 iodothyroine deiodinase (DIO1) splicing variants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013690-PiekielkoWitkowska1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013690-Gereben1">[5]</xref> and untranslated regions of thyroid hormone receptor TRβ1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013690-Master1">[6]</xref>. Several other reports showing ccRCC-specific disturbances of alternative splicing include alterations in mRNA processing of Mcl-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013690-Kempkensteffen1">[7]</xref>, TCF-4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013690-Shiina1">[8]</xref>, survivin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013690-Mahotka1">[9]</xref>, and OGG1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013690-Audebert1">[10]</xref>. Abnormally spliced variants of genes described above are rarely effects of mutations in genes coding for spliced transcripts and the sources of disturbances in alternative splicing are usually unknown.</p>
<p>Alternative splicing is a complicated process, involving a significant number of proteins including splicing factors called serine-arginine rich proteins (SR proteins) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013690-Long1">[11]</xref>. The family of SR proteins consists of at least twenty members of which seven: SF2/ASF (encoded by gene: SFRS1), SC35 (gene: SFRS2), SRp20 (gene: SFRS3), SRp75 (gene: SFRS4), SRp40 (gene: SFRS5), SRp55 (SFRS6), and 9G8 (SFRS7) constitute the group of “classical” SR proteins. These factors bind to sequences called splicing enhancers, located in exons (ESEs, exonic splicing enhancers) or in introns (ISEs, intronic splicing enhancers). Binding of SR proteins to splicing enhancers promotes exon inclusion. The splicing reaction is also regulated by a large number of non-SR factors, such as hnRNPs (heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins) which mainly bind to sequences of splicing silencers and act as splicing repressors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013690-He1">[12]</xref>. Thus, the final result of alternative splicing is an effect of the concert action of antagonistically acting splicing factors. One pair of splicing factors exhibiting opposite activities is SF2/ASF (an SR protein) and hnRNP A1 (heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1; a non-SR protein) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013690-Cceres1">[13]</xref>. Excess of SF2/ASF promotes proximal 5′ splice site selection while of hnRNP A1 favours distal 5′ splice site. Specific members of SR family may also act antagonistically (e.g. SF2/ASF and SRp20 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013690-Gonalves1">[14]</xref>, or SF2/ASF and SC35 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013690-ExpertBezanon1">[15]</xref>). Thus, relative levels of specific splicing factors contribute to regulation of alternative splicing, specific for tissue type and developmental stage.</p>
<p>It is known that disturbances in alternative splicing may contribute to carcinogenesis due to production of tumor-suppressive or oncogenic variants of gene transcripts, affecting proliferation, cell motility, and apoptosis susceptibility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013690-Venables1">[16]</xref>. Improperly spliced transcript variants may also serve as tumor biomarkers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013690-Brinkman1">[17]</xref>. The growing body of evidence suggests that splicing factors may be directly involved in the process of carcinogenesis, acting as proto-oncogenes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013690-Karni1">[18]</xref> or regulating splicing and activity of proto-oncogenes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013690-Ghigna1">[19]</xref>, tumor suppressors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013690-Karni1">[18]</xref> and apoptosis regulators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013690-Schwerk1">[20]</xref>. Disturbed expression of splicing factors was reported in several types of cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013690-Long1">[11]</xref>. In our recent paper we showed that the expression of two splicing factors, SF2/ASF and hnRNP A1 is disturbed in ccRCC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013690-PiekielkoWitkowska1">[4]</xref> but to our knowledge the expression of splicing factors as a group had never been analyzed in ccRCC.</p>
<p>In this paper we hypothesized that the observed disturbances of alternative splicing in ccRCC may be a consequence of changes in expression of splicing factors, in particular, of aberrations of quantitative relations between them. To address this problem, we analyzed expression of seven classical splicing factors: SF2/ASF, SC35, SRp20, SRp75, SRp40, SRp55, 9G8 and a non-SR factor, hnRNP A1. In addition, to investigate the consequences of disturbed expression of splicing factors, we analyzed existence and expression of transcripts of five genes involved in tumorigenesis, that are known to be alternatively spliced and partially regulated by the analyzed splicing factors. We found that the expression of splicing factors as well as alternative splicing of analyzed genes were disturbed in majority of analyzed tissue samples. We conclude that disturbed expression of splicing factors in ccRCC may possibly lead to impaired alternative splicing of genes regulating tumor growth and therefore contributing to the process of carcinogenesis.</p>

<title>The mRNA expression of splicing factors is disturbed in at least half of ccRCC samples</title>
<p>Splicing factors belonging to the group of SR proteins comprise a large number of structurally and functionally related proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013690-Long1">[11]</xref>. In our study we focused on the group of “classical” SR proteins, i.e. SF2/ASF (encoded by gene: SFRS1), SC35 (SFRS2), Sp20 (SFRS3), SRp75 (SFRS4), SRp40 (SFRS5), SRp55 (SFRS6), and 9G8 (SFRS7). We have also analyzed expression of a non-SR splicing factor, hnRNP A1 that is generally believed to act as antagonist of SR proteins.</p>
<p>Using real-time PCR we found that the pattern of expression of splicing factors differed between individual patients, as well as between control and tumor samples of a particular patient. mRNA expression of all analyzed splicing factors was disturbed in about 50–60% (depending on the splicing factor analyzed) of tumor samples compared with paired normal tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013690-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). These changes of expression were due to down- or upregulation of the analyzed genes and allowed us to divide all tumor samples into three pools: D, U, and N in which the expression of genes was downregulated, upregulated or not changed, respectively. The direction of changes did not correlate with tumor grade of differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013690-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>).</p>

Downregulation of genes in pools D varied from 1.9 fold (SRp20) to 2.6 fold (SC35 ad SRp75) when compared with control samples. Genes in pools U were upregulated from 1.4 fold (9G8) to 2.4 fold (SF2/ASF) when compared with control samples.</p>

The strongest changes in correlation were observed for hnRNP A1. For instance, there was no significant correlation between hnRNP A1 and SRp20, hnRNP A1 and SRp75, and hnRNP A1 and 9G8 in control samples, while in tumor samples the expression of these genes correlated significantly. Also, correlation between SF2/ASF and the residual six analyzed splicing factors was stronger in tumor samples.</p>

The SF2/ASF: hnRNP A1 ratio was decreased in tumor samples by about 26% (1.07±0.06 S.E. for C vs 0.78±0.06 S.E. for T; p = 0.0022). The ratio of SC35: SRp55 was increased in tumor samples by about 40% (median 1.12, range 0.60 to 5.91 for C; median 1.57, range 0.59 to 12.29 for T; p = 0.0073). For the ratio hnRNP A1: SC35 there was a small (15.3%) but statistically significant increase in tumors in comparison to control samples (0.77±0.05 S.E. for C vs 0.89±0.064 S.E. for T; p = 0.0197).</p>

<p>We found that levels of different splicing variants of analyzed genes varied between the majority of the twelve analyzed pairs of control and tumor samples in which protein level of SF2/ASF and hnRNP A1 was analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013690-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>). Expression of RON proto-oncogene splice variants Ron and ΔRon differed between samples of specific grades of differentiation. In all G3 tumor samples the ratio ΔRon/Ron was higher than in paired control samples. In samples G1 tumor-specific ratio ΔRon/Ron was higher or similar in comparison to control samples. In samples taken from patient number 13 both isoforms were absent in tumor and control samples. In tumor samples classified as G2 the ratio ΔRon/Ron was variable: in two tumor samples it was similar as in paired controls, in one sample it was higher than in paired control and in one sample it was lower than in paired control. Splicing patterns of CEACAM1 did not depend on the differentiation grade of tumor sample. In seven sample pairs the ratio CEACAM1-S/CEACAM1-L was higher in tumors than in control samples. In two sample pairs CEACAM1-S was not detected. Splicing pattern of Rac1 was similar in majority of analyzed samples. The ratio Rac1b/Rac1 was higher in control samples than in paired tumors in eleven of analyzed tissue pairs. Seven of analyzed sample pairs revealed higher ratio of Caspase-9b/Caspase-9a in tumors than in control samples independently of differentiation grades. Splicing pattern of GLI1 was the most variable. The ratio of GLI1-FL/GLI1-ΔN in seven tumor samples was higher than in paired controls. In two pairs of samples there were no differences between ratios of analyzed splice variants; however additional bands were visible, suggesting presence of not identified splice variants.</p>
<p>In order to find possible connection between changes in expression of SF2/ASF and splicing of SF2/ASF-regulated genes we performed Pearson correlation analysis between the expression of splicing factors and the target exon splicing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013690-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). Positive correlation (r = 0.6915, p = 0.0127) between Caspase-9a and SF2/ASF protein was observed in tumor but not in control samples (r = 0.004644, p = 0.9886). We also found a positive correlation (r = 0.6187, p = 0.0320) between CEACAM1-L and SF2/ASF protein in tumors but not in control samples (r = 0.4482, p = 0.1439).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this paper we show that mRNA expression of eight splicing factors is disturbed in ccRCC. The protein expression of two splicing factors, known to act antagonistically, SF2/ASF and hnRNP A1 is also disturbed. These aberrations are accompanied by impaired alternative splicing of SF2/ASF dependent genes, RON, Caspase-9, and Rac1. Tumor-specific disturbances of alternative splicing were also found for GLI1 oncogene and CEACAM1 tumor suppressor.</p>
<p>Changes in pre-mRNA splicing are a common phenomenon in human malignancies. According to our findings, improperties in expression of splicing factors occur in at least half (50–60%) of analyzed samples, although the disturbances are diverse and result from both up- and downregulation of splicing factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013690-g001">Fig. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013690-g002">2</xref>). The direction of changes is not specific for tumor grades of differentiation since both up- and downregulation were observed in all gradings. It is notable that although most of the publications refer to tumor-specific increase of splicing factors expression, the percentage of samples in which the disturbed expression occurs is rarely shown. Karni et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013690-Karni1">[18]</xref> reported that among 50 analyzed ccRCC samples more than 2-fold overexpression of SF2/ASF mRNA was observed in less than 5% of samples. According to our analysis the percentage of samples with more than 2-fold overexpression was a little higher (8%) but this difference may result from relatively small number of analyzed samples.</p>
<p>Interestingly, we found that patterns of mRNA and protein expression of splicing factors differed between individual patients and also between control and tumor samples of a given patient. This is in agreement with our previous study showing tumor-specific and patient-specific splicing patterns of type 1 iodothyronine deiodinase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013690-PiekielkoWitkowska1">[4]</xref> and with other studies, showing that ccRCC is characterized by molecular heterogeneity and can be separated into gene expression subgroups <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013690-Takahashi1">[31]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013690-Zhao1">[33]</xref>. In the study of Zhao et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013690-Zhao1">[33]</xref> those expression subgroups correlated with survival after surgery but, similarly as in our study, did not correlate with tumor grades. Unfortunately, in case of our study the patients were not followed up thus it is not possible to analyze any correlations between expression profiles and patients survival. Klein et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013690-Klein1">[34]</xref> analyzed single residual tumor cells from several types of tumors (but not of kidney origin) and found high heterogeneity of gene expression between particular cancer cells. Those cells were heterogeneous irrespective of whether they resided within the same compartment or within different homing sites. Patient specific variation in gene expression was also reported for breast and prostate cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013690-Perou1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013690-Ahram1">[36]</xref>.</p>
<p>This gene expression variability is an interesting issue, and at least two possible origins should be considered: that the variations reflect the tumor specificity or that they reflect individual patient features that result in a specific picture of gene expression in tumor. The first situation was described for liver cancer in which separate tumors from a single patient showed dramatic differences in gene expression patterns <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013690-Chen1">[37]</xref>. On the other hand, Perou et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013690-Perou1">[35]</xref> reported that gene expression patterns of different breast tumor samples taken from one patient were more similar to each other than to samples taken from other patients. It is not clear which situation concerns our study as we analyzed single samples per patient. As we have recently shown, however, ccRCC tumors may also reveal more homogenous gene expression patterns <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013690-Master1">[6]</xref>. In that study in which we used partially the same material as in this paper, we found highly consistent ccRCC tumor specific disturbances of thyroid hormone pathway: decrease of thyroid hormone receptor β1 (TRβ1) mRNA and protein, loss of type 1 iodothyonine deiodinase protein and lowered level of thyroid hormone, triiodothyronine (T3). Interestingly, TRβ1 protein decrease was observed in all twelve pairs of tumor and control samples that were subsequently used for our study. These observations are in agreement with findings of Takahashi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013690-Takahashi1">[31]</xref> who identified groups of genes that were similarly or differentially expressed in ccRCC. Thus, the consistent changes in thyroid hormone pathway may possibly represent the cell from which the tumor originated, while different gene expression patterns of splicing factors may reflect later events in tumor growth, including mutations as well as epigenetic and chromosomal alterations.</p>
<p>We observed increase of Pearson coefficients between mRNA expression of splicing factors in tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013690-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). These positive correlations were observed in tumors collected from different patients and confirmed that the observed changes in expression result from cancer specific disturbances in tumor tissue and not from individual differences between patients. Coordinated changes in expression of splicing factors may suggest the existence of not yet identified factor that affects the expression of the whole group of genes involved in splicing. Our observations are consistent with findings of Warrenfeltz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013690-Warrenfeltz1">[38]</xref> who found that functionally related genes displayed correlated changes of expression in ovarian cancer. The coordinated changes of gene expression may result from several causes. Genes that are located in similar regions of chromatin may be concomitantly influenced by changes in chromatin structure or by changes in chromosome regions. The majority of genes analyzed in our study is located on different chromosomes (apart from SFRS1 and SFRS2 that are located on chromosome 17), thus this effect is rather not responsible for the observed changes. Another reason could be the changed activity of a transcription factor that regulates expression of analyzed splicing factors. Such co-regulation of several splicing factors by one factor is possible, as shown by Mole et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013690-Mole1">[39]</xref>, who discovered that expression of SF2/ASF, SC35 and SRp75 is upregulated by human papillomavirus HPV16 infection, possibly via activation of transcription, controlled by the viral transcription factor E2. There are known transcription factors whose expression is changed in ccRCC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013690-Master1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013690-Tun1">[40]</xref>, however the question whether they are also regulators of splicing factors remains for further investigation.</p>
<p>The relative amounts of SR- and non-SR splicing factors, such as hnRNP A1, may determine patterns of alternative splicing of many genes. We found that relative amounts of pairs of splicing factors that are known to act antagonistically statistically significant differed in tumors in comparison to paired control samples. This was especially visible for antagonistic pair SF2/ASF and hnRNP A1 whose ratio is known to influence 5′ splice site selection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013690-Cceres1">[13]</xref>. When the level of hnRNP A1 is higher than of SF2/ASF, distal 5′ splice site is preferred. In our work the ratio SF2/ASF: hnRNP A1 was significantly lowered in ccRCC samples in comparison to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013690-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). This result is in agreement with our previous analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013690-PiekielkoWitkowska1">[4]</xref> in which the predominant variants of type 1 iodothyronine deiodinase (DIO1) found in ccRCC were those resulting from distal 5′ splice site usage.</p>
<p>Apart from disturbed expression, several other factors may also contribute to improperties in functionality of splicing factors. One of them could be disturbed protein phosphorylation, the modification which determines activity of splicing factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013690-PiekiekoWitkowska1">[41]</xref>. Of note, Western blot analysis of SF2/ASF and hnRNP A1 revealed additional or shifted bands that are characteristic for differently phosphorylated proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013690-Hanamura1">[30]</xref>. One of kinases pathway that regulate phosphorylation of splicing factors is PI3K/Akt <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013690-Patel1">[42]</xref>. Interestingly, this pathway is disturbed in ccRCC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013690-Porta1">[43]</xref> and thus may possibly contribute to impaired activity of splicing factors. To confirm, however, that phosphorylation of splicing factors is disturbed in ccRCC, further analysis is needed. Another posttranslational modification affecting the activity of splicing factors is poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013690-Gagn1">[44]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013690-Ji1">[46]</xref>. There are no direct data showing changes in poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase activity in ccRCC; it was shown, however, that nephrocarcinogens induce poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of renal proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013690-McLaren1">[47]</xref>. There are also other modifications that may affect the activity of splicing factors such as sumoylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013690-Matafora1">[48]</xref>, and arginine methylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013690-Liu1">[49]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013690-Sinha1">[50]</xref>; however further studies are needed to reveal whether they play any role in ccRCC pathology.</p>
<p>Disturbances of alternative splicing directly contribute to tumorigenesis due to synthesis of alternative products that exert tumor growth promoting activities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013690-Hartmann1">[51]</xref>. Splicing factors themselves may also act as proto-oncogenes, as it was shown for SF2/ASF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013690-Karni1">[18]</xref>. The complex changes of eight splicing factors in ccRCC samples found in our work may thus result in alterations of splicing reactions. Indeed, we show here that alternative splicing of five genes is disturbed in analyzed tumor tissues. Importantly, these genes are known to influence the process of tumorigenesis. We found a positive correlation between Caspase-9a and SF2/ASF protein in tumor but not in control samples. Similar positive correlation was found between CEACAM1-L and SF2/ASF protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013690-g006">Fig. 6</xref>.). Positive correlation between expression of SF2/ASF and Caspase-9a is in agreement with the observation that SF2/ASF enhances the expression of Caspase-9a isoform <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013690-Massiello1">[22]</xref>. Lack of correlation between Caspase-9a/9b ratio suggests that additional factors may influence the splicing of Caspase-9 as for instance selective degradation of splice variant 9b or regulatory effect of other proteins. It was shown that splicing of Caspase-9 is affected by E2F1 and SC35 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013690-Merdzhanova1">[52]</xref>. Interestingly, as we showed, the expression of E2F1 is disturbed in ccRCC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013690-Turowska1">[53]</xref>. The observation that the expression of SF2/ASF and Caspase-9a correlates positively in tumorous but not in control samples may possibly suggest that while in non-cancerous kidney tissues the splicing of Caspase-9 is affected by multiple different factors (for instance, by E2F1 and SC35), in cancer tissues SF2/ASF may play the main role.</p>
<p>The pathway of programmed cell death is disturbed in ccRCC due to loss of apoptosis inducers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013690-Zhou1">[54]</xref> or upregulation of apoptosis inhibitors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013690-Mizutani1">[55]</xref>. Our results showing changed ratios of proapoptotic [9a] and antiapoptotic [9b] Caspase-9 splice variants in tumor tissue samples resemble those found for survivin, a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) family <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013690-Mahotka1">[9]</xref>. Mahotka et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013690-Mahotka1">[9]</xref> analyzed survivin splice variants that showed different antiapoptotic properties and found that the mRNA ratio between survivin-2B (the isoform lacking antiapoptotic activity) and survivin is decreased in late tumor stages of ccRCC. Disturbances of apoptotic pathway are also confirmed in this study, showing imbalanced ratios of GLI1 variants. GLI1 is a transcription factor of oncogenic potential <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013690-FernndezZapico1">[56]</xref> that increases expression of a number of antiapoptotic factors. Moreover, it was shown that GLI1 mRNA expression is upregulated in ccRCC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013690-Dormoy1">[57]</xref>. Together these results suggest that ccRCC specific disturbances of apoptosis may result not only from general changes of levels of apoptotic regulators but also from perturbations of alternative splicing.</p>
<p>CEACAM1 is an adhesion molecule of particularly broad effects on cancerous growth and invasion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013690-Obrink1">[58]</xref>. It affects cell adhesion, apoptosis, morphogenesis, cell proliferation, invasion, cell migration, angiogenesis, lymphangiogenesis and cytotoxicity. The activity of CEACAM1 is regulated by alternative splicing that generates two types of cytoplasmic domain: short (present in CEACAM1-S isoform) and long (present in CEACAM1-L) one. Both CEACAM1-L and CEACAM1-S were shown to inhibit tumor growth when transfected and expressed in different types of cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013690-Kleinerman1">[59]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013690-Luo1">[61]</xref>. It was suggested that the ratio of S: L isoforms may define suppressive properties of particular isoforms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013690-Gaur1">[23]</xref> and that CEACAM1-L activity may be inhibited by CEACAM1-S <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013690-Mller1">[62]</xref>. Our results showing increased S:L ratio in tumor cells are consistent with antagonistic properties of the two CEACAM1 isoforms. Interestingly, Kammerer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013690-Kammerer1">[63]</xref> found that CEACAM1 protein is completely lost in ccRCC; however, this group did not analyze CEACAM1 mRNA level or splicing patterns in cancer tissues. There are no data showing that CEACAM1-L is a target of SF2/ASF or any other splicing factor analyzed in our study. However, Gaur et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013690-Gaur1">[23]</xref> identified cis-acting splicing regulatory elements located in exon 7 of CEACAM1. Analysis of CEACAM1 exon 7 revealed several high-score motifs for SF2/ASF, SC35, SRp40, and SRP55 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013690-g007">Fig. 7</xref>). Although a score above threshold does not necessarily mean that the sequence functions as an exonic splicing enhancer, these results together with positive correlation between the level of CEACAM1-L and SF2/ASF and the presence of regulatory cis acting elements in CEACAM1 exon 7 suggest that SF2/ASF may play a regulatory role in CEACAM1 splicing. This issue needs further confirmation by experimental data showing direct binding between CEACAM1 exon 7 and SF2/ASF.</p>
<p>We did not find any correlation between SF2/ASF (or hnRNP A1) and the splicing pattern of Ron, Rac1 or GLI-1 which may possibly suggest that other factors may play a role in regulation of these genes' splicing. RON tyrosine kinase is a proto-oncogene that controls invasive growth of tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013690-Benvenuti1">[64]</xref>. Alternatively spliced isoforms of RON found in cancers promote changes in tumor cell morphology, stimulate proliferation and abrogate cell-cell adhesion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013690-Ghigna1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013690-Bardella1">[65]</xref>. RON dependent cell motility is regulated by SF2/ASF that controls alternative splicing of this protooncogene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013690-Ghigna1">[19]</xref>. It was shown that ccRCC tumors classified as G3 and G2 differentiation grades have higher metastasis rates compared to that of grade G1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013690-Novara1">[66]</xref>. As ΔRON is a constitutively active isoform that triggers invasive tumor growth and whose accumulation is observed in colon and breast cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013690-Ghigna1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013690-Zhou2">[67]</xref>, our results showing higher tumor-specific ΔRON/RON ratio in all tumor samples classified as G3 grade are in line with those observations.</p>
<p>Rac1 is a member of Rho-like GTPases that affect changes in actin cytoskeleton and regulate cell adhesion, migration and invasion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013690-Bosco1">[68]</xref>. Alternative splicing regulates cancer-related properties of Rac1, leading to synthesis of constitutively active Rac1b, whose expression is upregulated in cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013690-Jordan1">[24]</xref>. Moreover, Rac1b expression in NIH-3T3 cells causes growth transformation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013690-Singh1">[69]</xref> and determines survival of colon cancer cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013690-Matos1">[70]</xref>. Our results showing that ratio of Rac1b: Rac1 is higher in controls than in ccRCC samples suggest that this isoform rather does not play tumor promoting role in ccRCC. This is in line with previous findings of Engers et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013690-Engers1">[71]</xref> who showed that forced expression of Rac1 in ccRCC cells leads to inhibition of cell migration and invasion. This group, however, did not look at the splicing profile of Rac1, therefore the exact role of Rac1b in ccRCC remains for further investigations.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we show that changes in expression of splicing factors belonging to SR proteins family and a non-SR protein, hnRNP A1, may possibly lead to disturbances of alternative splicing in ccRCC. These disturbances may potentially be directly connected with tumor progression as they result in impaired alternative splicing of genes involved in apoptosis, and cell adhesion. We suggest that changes in correlation between expression levels of splicing factors may potentially serve as markers of carcinogenesis in ccRCC and that splicing factors may possibly constitute therapeutic targets in patients with disturbed expression of specific splicing regulators. This last possibility was already successfully tested on cancer cell lines by Patry et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013690-Patry1">[72]</xref>.</p>
