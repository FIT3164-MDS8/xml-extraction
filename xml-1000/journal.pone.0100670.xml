<abstract>
<p>We have designed and tested a new way to selectively deliver HPMA polymer-coated adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) particles into matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-overexpressing tumor cells. An activatable cell penetrating peptide (ACPP) was designed and attached to the reactive 4-nitrophenoxy groups of HPMA polymers by the C-terminal amino acid (asparagine, N). ACPPs are activatable cell penetrating peptides (CPPs) with a linker between polycationic and polyanionic domains, and MMP-mediated cleavage releases the CPP portion and its attached cargo to enable cell entry. Our data indicate that the transport of these HPMA polymer conjugates by a single ACPP molecule to the cytoplasm occurs via a nonendocytotic and concentration-independent process. The uptake was observed to finish within 20 minutes by inverted fluorescence microscopy. In contrast, HPMA polymer-coated Ad5 without ACPPs was internalized solely by endocytosis. The optimal formulation was not affected by the presence of Ad5 neutralizing antibodies during transduction, and ACPP/polymer-coated Ad5 also retained high targeting capability to several MMP-overexpressing tumor cell types. For the first time, ACPP-mediated cytoplasmic delivery of polymer-bound Ad5 to MMP-overexpressing tumor cells was demonstrated. These findings are significant, as they demonstrate the use of a polymer-based system for the targeted delivery into MMP-overexpressing solid tumors and highlight how to overcome major cellular obstacles to achieve intracellular macromolecular delivery.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Adenovirus (AdV) is a widely used vector for cancer gene therapy because of its capacity for transgene expression in both dividing and nondividing cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100670-Bergelson1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100670-Campos1">[4]</xref>. However, when they are to be delivered intravenously to treat primary tumor or metastatic disease, the wide tissue distribution of the coxsackie and adenovirus receptor (CAR, the primary receptor for adenovirus type 5) precludes target selectivity, and neutralization of adenovirus by pre-existing antibodies can ablate the delivery. Further, the virus can provoke immune responses which prevents repeated dosing and limits the duration of therapeutic gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100670-Yang1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100670-Searle1">[6]</xref>. These factors have largely limited therapeutic use of adenovirus to local or direct administration. A useful viral gene therapy vector should be protected from neutralizing antibodies and enable delivery to target cells.</p>
<p>Addressing these challenges necessitates alternative approaches to redirect AdV type 5 (Ad5) for CAR-independent cellular internalization. Synthetic materials such as cationic lipids and cationic polymers have been used to modify AdV to improve cellular uptake <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100670-Fasbender1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100670-Han1">[14]</xref>. However, pEGylated virus still exhibits CAR-mediated infection, which results in nonspecific membrane activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100670-ORiordan1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100670-Chillon1">[17]</xref>. Thus, hydrophilic poly-[N-(2-hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide] (pHPMA) has received attention as a more attractive polymer for this purpose. A previous study showed that pHPMA is the optimal means of modification, as it ablates normal pathways of Ad5 infection completely, prolongs the circulation time in blood <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100670-Green1">[18]</xref>, increases the accumulation of Ad5 by the EPR (enhanced permeability and retention) effect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100670-Fisher1">[19]</xref> and permits incorporation of a range of targeting molecules and biological effectors to enhance properties such as programming tropism, as well as tissue penetration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100670-Morrison1">[20]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100670-Nori1">[30]</xref>. To the best of our knowledge, a detailed investigation of pHPMA modification used to potentiate Ad5 infection and target solid tumor cells has not been reported.</p>
<p>We report here the development of a covalent coating and retargeting strategy using a multivalent hydrophilic polymer based on poly-[N-(2- hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide] (pHPMA) and activatable cell-penetrating peptides (ACPPs). Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) are peptides that can translocate through the cellular membranes, such as TAT, Antp, VP22, and polyarginine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100670-Green3">[31]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100670-Oess1">[35]</xref>, and are being used to deliver various cargoes into the cell, including proteins, DNA, antibodies, toxins and nanoparticulate drug carriers (including pHPMA) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100670-Mi1">[36]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100670-Torchilin1">[44]</xref>. ACPPs are polycationic peptides (polyarginine) which are neutralized by polyanionic (polyglutamic acid) sequences through the fusion of cleavable linkers. Only in the immediate vicinity of extracellular proteases [matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)] in tumors are ACPPs released from the polycationic peptides, allowing their cargo to attach to and enter cells. Because MMP-2 and MMP-9 are proteases mostly overexpressed by tumors, they were chosen as the initial primary targets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100670-Jiang1">[45]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100670-Ratnikov1">[52]</xref>. Incorporation of targeting ACPPs onto the polymer-coated virus enables CPP-mediated and CAR-independent binding and uptake into cells overexpressing MMPs. Thus, ACPPs are an effective means of altering viral tropism and targeting tumor cells. Based on the selective local targeting and activation of CPPs, multivalent polymeric modification of adenovirus may provide the ability to retarget viruses to infect human carcinoma cells. As a non-genetic process, the technology is simple, versatile and should yield viruses with an improved safety profile.</p>

<p>MMPs are the best characterized soluble proteases in the overexpressed tumors and are responsible for the degradation of extracellular matrix. We integrated substrates(-PLGLAG-) as cleavable linkers between the polyanion inhibition (EEEEEEEE) and polycation sequence(RRRRRRRRN), so that the polycation peptide could be cleaved by MMPs and penetrate the MMP-overexpressing tumor cells, while in HBE cell line, such MMPs activities would be too low to conduct this enzyme cleavage, leading to no polycation peptide penetration. On the other hand, the MMPs-overexpressed cell lines treated with MMPs inhibitor doxycycline should have lower ACPP cell penetration because MMPs inhibitor doxycycline can decrease the MMPs level.</p>
<p>The immunofluorescence and ACPP penetration assay were performed to confirm this hypothesis. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0100670-g003">Figure 3</xref>, immunofluorescence staining displayed the high fluorescence intensity in A549, MDA-MB-231, HepG2 cells and light fluorescence intensity in HBE cell for MMP-2.

<p>To test the ability of polymer-coated adenovirus to infect cells, the expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP), encoded by the recombinant Ad5 virus (Ad-eGFP), was assayed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0100670-g007">Figure 7</xref>). When A549 human lung carcinoma cells were infected with 10<sup>4</sup> particles Ad-eGFP/cell, pc-Ad-eGFP displayed no detectable fluorescent signal at 24 h, while over 90% of A549 cells showed bright fluorescence after infection with ACPP-pc-Ad-eGFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0100670-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). Next, GFP expression was measured with a fluorescence plate reader (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0100670-g007">Figure 7B</xref>) to quantitatively measure the ability of the virus to infect A549 cells. We found that pc-Ad-eGFP infection was essentially ablated by the coating procedure, while ACPP-pc-Ad-eGFP penetrated the A549 cells successfully, showing little ablation of GFP expression.</p>

<p>To check the ability of polymer-coated virus to enter cells, the ability of ACPPs to mediate uptake of pc viruses into MMPs overexpressing cells was determined by flow cytometry of A549 cells following 4 h incubation at 37°C with RRPMI-1640, Ad-eGFP, pc- Ad-eGFP (PI) and ACPPs -pc- Ad-eGFP (PI).Uptake of pc-Ad-eGFP(PI) by A549 cells during 4 h incubation at 37°C was effectively abolished by the presence of the polymer coat. However, the ACPPs mediated uptake levelof pc-Ad-eGFP(PI) by A549 cells,which is similar to that of the unmodified Ad-eGFP (PI),seemed almost unaffected by the presence of the polymer coat. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0100670-g006">Figure 6c</xref>), indicating that ACPPs facilitated the internalization of pc-Ad-eGFP.</p>
<p>The ability of ACPP-pc-Ad-eGFP to evade neutralizing antibodies was tested by examining the inhibition of adenoviral transduction. The modified virus was incubated with human serum known to contain anti-adenovirus neutralizing antibodies, and the polymer coating was found to protect the virus against NAb binding, while NAb significantly inhibited uncoated Ad5 transduction. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0100670-g008">Figure 8</xref> shows that ACPP-pc-Ad-eGFP is 9-fold more resistant to neutralization than Ad-eGFP.

<p>To test the feasibility of retargeting, ACPPs were chosen because these molecules had previously been shown to retarget cargoes to MMP-overexpressing cells. Targeting ACPPs were chemically attached to the reactive ester groups remaining on the surface of the pc virus, and this modified virus was purified from free polymer and free targeting agents using S400 spin columns 27-5140-01 as described previously. After HBE, A549, MDA-MB-231 and HepG2 cells were incubated with ACPP-pc-Ad-eGFP(PI) for 1 h at 37°C, the ability of ACPPs to target the MMP-overexpressing cells was determined by measuring GFP expression. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0100670-g009">Figure 9</xref> shows that when cell lines were infected with this retargeted virus, the trend in cellular uptake of ACPP-pc-Ad-eGFP(PI) was as follows: A549, MDA-MB-231, HepG2 and HBE (ii, iii, iv and i, respectively). ACPP-pc-Ad-eGFP showed relatively low infectivity in HBE cells, while significantly enhanced GFP expression could be seen in A549, MDA-MB-231, and HepG2 cells, suggesting that selective infection in MMP-overexpressing tumor cells should be feasible.</p>

<p>To investigate the time-dependence of the internalization process, Ad-eGFP was labeled with the fluorescent dye PI and employed in a fluorescence microscopy assay. Studies performed with ACPP-pc-Ad-eGFP(PI) at 37°C showed cytoplasmic uptake of Ad-eGFP(PI) at 20 min, 2 h and 4 h. The intensity of PI fluorescence was significantly stronger (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0100670-g012">Figure 12A-C</xref>) than that of the control pc-Ad-mda-7-eGFP particles lacking an ACPP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0100670-g012">Figure 12D-F</xref>). Increasing the period of incubation with ACPP-pc-Ad-eGFP resulted in the cells showing a persistent increase in fluorescence intensity within the cytoplasm. The results indicate that the uptake of Ad-eGFP is time-dependent, with localization to the cytoplasm able to occur within 20 min.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The use of ACPPs, which possess a targeting mechanism based on selective local separation from CPPs, is a flexible strategy that concentrates the therapeutic conjugates in the immediate vicinity of MMP-overexpressing solid tumors. By means of proteolytic activation of ACPP, we believe the use of pc-Ad- eGFP conjugates possesses several advantages. First, Uptake of most pc-Ad5 was observed to occur via endocytotic pathway and localized solely in vesicular compartments with no uptake into the cytoplasm,ACPP facilitated the penetration of the pc-Ad-eGFP through the cell membrane directly and the entry into the cytoplasm The localization in the cytoplasm of Ad-eGFP are important for effective expression of therapeutic adenovirus. Second, this system allows the diameter of the delivery cargo to be up to polymers of several nanometers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100670-Lewin1">[58]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100670-Zhao1">[60]</xref>. As they are appended to the polycationic portion of ACPP, polymers, which often taken up by endocytosis, can be carried into the cytoplasm after linker cleavage. With the ACPPs, the excessive molecular mass overcomes the disadvantage of decreasing penetration into solid tumors with high interstitial fluid pressure. Third, it should be adaptable to a wide variety of solid tumors, as at least 26 members of the MMPs family have been identified, and they are the best characterized proteases overexpressed by tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100670-TalvensaariMattila1">[61]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0100670-SounniN1">[65]</xref>.</p>
<p>By modification of the surface of adenovirus with multivalent reactive 4-nitrophenoxy groups, pHPMA ablates their normal receptor binding properties, shields the virus from recognition by neutralizing antibodies, and permits incorporation of target molecules for virus retargeting. The convincing evidence that adenovirus can be targeted to MMP-overexpressing tumors and infect cells efficiently by means of proteolytic activation of cell-penetrating peptides has important implications for the intravenous administration of gene therapy vectors. Our finding that adenoviruses can be retargeted to MMP-overexpressing tumors provides an opportunity to refine their distribution kinetics and their tissue tropism in vivo, and permits the use of lower viral doses by avoiding CAR-mediated infection of non-target tissues. In addition, evidence of diminished neutralization by anti-adenovirus antibodies should enable the use of lower doses. We anticipate that this system will enable successful application of adenovirus gene therapy vectors with significantly decreased toxicity.</p>
