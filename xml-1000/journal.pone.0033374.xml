        <p><italic>Lycium barbarum</italic>, commonly known as wolfberry, has been used as a traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of infertility and sexual dysfunction. However, there is still a scarcity of experimental evidence to support the pro-sexual effect of wolfberry. The aim of this study is to determine the effect of <italic>Lycium barbarum</italic> polysaccharides (LBP) on male sexual behavior of rats. Here we report that oral feeding of LBP for 21 days significantly improved the male copulatory performance including increase of copulatory efficiency, increase of ejaculation frequency and shortening of ejaculation latency. Furthermore, sexual inhibition caused by chronic corticosterone was prevented by LBP. Simultaneously, corticosterone suppressed neurogenesis in subventricular zone and hippocampus in adult rats, which could be reversed by LBP. The neurogenic effect of LBP was also shown <italic>in vitro</italic>. Significant correlation was found between neurogenesis and sexual performance, suggesting that the newborn neurons are associated with reproductive successfulness. Blocking neurogenesis in male rats abolished the pro-sexual effect of LBP. Taken together, these results demonstrate the pro-sexual effect of LBP on normal and sexually-inhibited rats, and LBP may modulate sexual behavior by regulating neurogenesis.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p><italic>Lycium barbarum</italic> (commonly known as wolfberry) has been used as an oriental herb in Asian countries for a long history <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033374-Chang1">[1]</xref>. Being an anti-aging herb, wolfberry has been used for maintaining eye health, nourishing the liver and kidney <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033374-Ho1">[2]</xref>. Increasing lines of evidence from both clinical and pre-clinical studies support the therapeutic and health-promoting effects of wolfberry. A randomized, placebo-controlled clinical study reveals the consumption of a juice prepared from wolfberry promoted health like improving quality of sleep, mental acuity and decreasing level of fatigue and stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033374-Amagase1">[3]</xref>. On the other hand, different pre-clinical studies aim at determining the precise biological activities of wolfberry and the active components exerting the effect. <italic>Lycium barbarum</italic> polysaccharides (LBP), as a major constituent of wolfberry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033374-Chiu1">[4]</xref>, have been shown to exert a wide range of biological effects, including neuroprotection against neurotoxic insults <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033374-Ho2">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033374-Li1">[6]</xref>, having anti-aging properties in an aging animal model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033374-Deng1">[7]</xref>, prevention of glaucoma induced by elevated intraocular pressure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033374-Chiu1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033374-Chan1">[8]</xref> and immune modulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033374-Gan1">[9]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Apart from the aforementioned effects, wolfberry was described to exhibit pro-sexual effect by the Chinese herbalist Li Shizhen, and thus wolfberry was included in sexual-enhancing Chinese herbal remedies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033374-Wang1">[10]</xref>. Daily consumption of wolfberry juice improves the well-being feeling towards sexuality, including increase in sexual activity and ability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033374-Amagase1">[3]</xref>. Several studies which focused on the reproductive system showed that LBP was beneficial to male reproduction in several aspects: first, the sexual performance of hemicastrated rats could be improved by LBP treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033374-Luo1">[11]</xref>; second, the quality, quantity and motility of sperms were increased <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033374-Luo2">[12]</xref> after LBP treatment;,third, damage of testis and seminiferous epithelium by different insults, such as hyperthermia, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and irradiation, were prevented by LBP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033374-Wang1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033374-Luo1">[11]</xref>; and finally, decreases in testosterone of hemicastrated or irradiated rats were reversed by LBP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033374-Luo1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033374-Luo2">[12]</xref>. These findings provided evidence to support the notion that LBP exerts therapeutic effects on male sexual performance and fertility, although the mechanisms underlying the effects remain largely unclear.</p>

          <p>(A): Animals were treated with 0, 1 or 10 mg/kg of LBP daily and sexual behavior tests were conducted at 7-day intervals. (B): The three groups of animals received vehicle (PBS), corticosterone (40 mg/kg) or both corticosterone and LBP treatment for 21 days. Sexual behavior test was conducted at day 21 and was followed by sacrifice of animals at day 22. (C): After intracerebroventricular infusion of either saline (with PBS treatment) or Ara-c (with LBP treatment) for seven days, the animals were subjected to sexual behavior test.</p>

      <p>Successful sexual behavior involves complex interplay among different systems including the reproductive system and the nervous system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033374-Mak1">[13]</xref>. While previous studies about the effect of LBP on sexual behavior focused on the reproductive system, there is scarce investigation of its influence on the nervous system. The olfactory system and hippocampus in the brain are important regions for perceiving sociosexual stimulus, processing social memory and induce social recognition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033374-Mak1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033374-Hawken1">[14]</xref>. These two regions are characterized by their continuous production of adult-born neurons (neurogenesis) during the life. Increasing lines of evidence suggests that neurogenesis may be involved in sexual behavior <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033374-Lau1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033374-Leuner1">[16]</xref>. For instance, increase in neurogenesis in the subventricular zone (SVZ, a region produces new neurons which migrate to the olfactory bulb) or hippocampus could be found when a female experimental animal was exposed to a male counterpart or sociosexual stimuli, which could be observed in different species like prairie voles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033374-Smith1">[17]</xref>, mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033374-Mak1">[13]</xref> and ewes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033374-Hawken1">[14]</xref>. If neurogenesis in the hippocampus and SVZ are blocked, the normal sexual behavior will be disrupted, including the mate-preference in female mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033374-Mak1">[13]</xref> and male mating behavior of rats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033374-Lau2">[18]</xref>. Furthermore, the newborn neurons were found to incorporate into the mating-related brain circuit in hamsters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033374-Huang1">[19]</xref>. These studies suggest that neurogenesis may have a reciprocal relationship with sexual behavior and the newborn neurons may have an important role in the regulation of sexual behavior.</p>
      <p>Given the traditional reputation of wolfberry in promoting sexual performance and the importance of neurogenesis in sexual behavior, we ask 1. whether treatment of LBP could improve male sexual behavior; 2. whether LBP could reverse sexual inhibition; 3. whether LBP affects neurogenesis in <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> situations and 4. if there is an association between LBP treatment, sexual behavior and neurogenesis. The results will not only provide evidence to support the pro-sexual functions of LBP, but also will provide insight on the biological mechanisms underlying LBP treatment.</p>

        <p>The experimental protocol was approved by the animal ethics committee of the University of Hong Kong (Committee on the Use of Live Animals in Teaching and Research; protocol #1961–09). Young adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (280±10 g) were used for the experiment. Animals were kept under a 12/12 light dark cycle at 22°C. Sexually naïve animals were used since disruption of sexual behavior is more obvious in sexually inexperienced animals. Animals were randomly assigned to three experiments: (1) Effect of LBP on sexual behavior at different dosages and time-points; (2) subchronic treatment with corticosterone and LBP and (3) effect of blocking neurogenesis in the pro-sexual effect of LBP.

        <p>Female rats (300±20 g, stimulus animals) were induced to become sexually receptive by subcutaneous injection of 50 µg of estradiol benzoate 48 h before testing which was followed by injection of 500 µg of progesterone 4 h before testing. The sexual behavior test was started 2 hours after the onset of dark phase and a dim red light source was used to illuminate the venue at 25–40 lux. Before testing, the subject animals were placed in standard rectangular plastic cages (25 (W) × 28 (D) × 24 (H) cm) for 10 minutes. Then, the sexually receptive females were introduced into the cage and the mating process was video-recorded for 45 minutes for later analysis. The analysis of the sexual performance was done by an experimenter blinded to the treatment conditions. The components observed were: i. mount latency (ML, in seconds): the time between introduction of the female rat and the first mount; ii. intromission latency (IL, in seconds): the time between introduction of the female rat and the first intromission; iii. Mount frequency (MF): number of mount displayed before ejaculation; iv. Intromission frequency (IF): number of intromission displayed before ejaculation; v. Copulatory efficiency (CE): Total number of intromission divided by the sum of intromission and mount frequency; vi. Ejaculation frequency (EF): number of ejaculation during the test session and vii. Ejaculation latency (EL): the time between the first intromission and ejaculation.</p>

        <title>LBP Reversed Sexual Behavior Inhibition Induced by Corticosterone</title>
        <p>Corticosterone resulted in decreased sexual performance when compared to vehicles-treated control animals in terms of significantly longer IL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033374-g003">Figure 3A</xref>), lower CE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033374-g003">Figure 3B</xref>), lower EF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033374-g003">Figure 3C</xref>) and longer EL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033374-g003">Figure 3D</xref>, p&lt;0.05 for the comparisons). Co-treatment with LBP (1 mg/kg) significantly reversed the inhibited sexual behavior, which is indicated by a significantly lower IL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033374-g003">Figure 3A</xref>) and higher CE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033374-g003">Figure 3B</xref>) than that of the corticosterone group (p&lt;0.05). Although no significant difference was found between the corticosterone group and co-treatment group in EF and EL, the co-treatment group did not show difference from the vehicle-treated group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033374-g003">Figure 3C and 3D</xref>).</p>

        <title>Blocking Neurogenesis Abolished the Pro-sexual Effect of LBP</title>
        <p>To determine the direct relationship between neurogenesis and sexual behavior, neurogenesis in animals treated with LBP were blocked with Ara-c infusion. Quantification of BrdU-positive cells in the SVZ and hippocampus of control animals (SA group: saline infusion and PBS feeding) and LBP/Ara-c treated animals (Ara-c group) showed that cell proliferation was significantly inhibited in the SVZ (SA: 618.3±32.7; Ara-c: 74.5+2.34; p&lt;0.01) and hippocampus (SA: 8501.5±551.6; Ara-c: 1561.7+283.8; p&lt;0.01) of Ara-c group. In contrast to experiment 1, blocking neurogenesis in LBP-treated animals did not result in improvement of sexual behavior in copulatory efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033374-g007">Figure 7A</xref>), ejaculation frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033374-g007">Figure 7B</xref>) or ejaculation latency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033374-g007">Figure 7C</xref>).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The present study demonstrated the enhancing effect of LBP on male sexual behavior in rats. In both experiments 1 and 2, the CE, EF and EL were improved by LBP and only IL was also improved in experiment 2. The effects of LBP appeared to enhance both motivation (indicated by IL) and copulatory performance (indicated by CE, EF and EL) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033374-Everitt1">[26]</xref>. Furthermore, it is shown that the improved sexual performance was associated with increased neurogenesis in the two neurogenic zones, suggesting that neurogenesis may be associated with the sexual-enhancing effects of LBP. The causal relationship between neurogenesis and sexual behavior was demonstrated in experiment 3, in which the sexual-enhancing effect of LBP was abolished by blocking neurogenesis.</p>
      <p>Wolfberry has been prescribed for treating male infertility for a long history, although there is a scarcity of scientific evidence for this indication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033374-Wang1">[10]</xref>. Recently a study revealed that an improved subjective view on sexual ability was found in subjects chronically consumed a juice prepared from wolfberry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033374-Amagase1">[3]</xref>. This study suggests the potential clinical use of wolfberry to improve male sexual performance.</p>
      <p>The findings of the present study showed the sexual-enhancing effect of LBP from a pre-clinical point of view. Our results showed that the beneficial effect was not only revealed in normal, healthy rats, but also in rats with sexual inhibition induced by corticosterone. The ‘rescuing’ effect of LBP on male sexual behavior suggests that LBP may be useful to treat male sexual dysfunction. This notion agrees with previous studies in which castration and irradiation on reproductive tissues suppressed male mating behavior, while LBP improved the mating ability of the affected rats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033374-Luo1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033374-Luo2">[12]</xref>. Apart from behavioral aspect, LBP may exert its beneficial effects on the reproductive system at cellular level. For example, LBP was found to protect spermatogenic cells from apoptosis induced by hyperthermia and the structural integrity of the seminiferous epithelium could be preserved by LBP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033374-Wang1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033374-Luo1">[11]</xref>. In short, the sexual-enhancing effect of LBP may be multi-faceted, ranging from protection of gametes against harmful insults to enhancement of individual sexual behavior. Thus, how does LBP benefit reproduction may warrant further investigations.</p>
      <p>The relationship between neurogenesis and sexual behavior shown in this study suggests that neurogenesis may be involved in copulation, and neurogenesis could be one of the mechanisms of how LBP exerts its pro-sexual effect. Neurogenesis could be found at different brain regions while the two most prominent neurogenic regions are the SVZ and hippocampus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033374-Das1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033374-Das2">[28]</xref>. Neural progenitor cells proliferate at the SVZ and migrate tangentially along the rostral migratory stream (RMS) to reach the olfactory bulb, which allows continuous addition of new neurons for formation of new circuits throughout the adulthood in rodents <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033374-AlvarezBuylla1">[29]</xref>. The renewal of interneurons in the olfactory bulb renders the ability of olfactory learning, including differentiating sex-related olfactory signals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033374-Gheusi1">[30]</xref>. As the hippocampus is well recognized for its necessity in memory formation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033374-Lee1">[31]</xref>, it may also take part in the formation of memory regarding the processing of sexual cues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033374-Slotnick1">[32]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Previous studies outlined the interrelationship between adult neurogenesis and sexual behavior. For instance, exposure of female prairie voles or ewes to males increased neurogenesis in the SVZ and hippocampus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033374-Hawken1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033374-Smith1">[17]</xref>. Another study showed that newborn cells in the olfactory bulbs integrated into the ‘mating’ circuit and could be activated by estrus female pheromones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033374-Huang1">[19]</xref>. More recent studies showed that neurogenesis is essential for the display of normal sexual behaviors in both female and male rodents <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033374-Mak1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033374-Lau2">[18]</xref>. Under normal situation, female mice prefer to mate with dominant males. When the neurogenesis in the SVZ and hippocampus were blocked by cytostatic cytosine arabinoside, the preference was then abolished <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033374-Mak1">[13]</xref>. On the other hand, when neurogenesis was suppressed in male rats, the sexual performance was impaired <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033374-Lau2">[18]</xref>. The decreased neurogenesis was associated with a decrease in neuronal activation in mating-related circuits, which may be the reason underlying the sexual inhibition. The present study further showed that blocking neurogenesis could abolish the sexual-enhancing effect of LBP. These observations indicate that adult neurogenesis warrants the reproductive success of rodents, and disruption of it would cause dysfunction in sexual behavior. In the present data, corticosterone suppressed both neurogenesis and sexual performance simultaneously while LBP could prevent these from occurring. The neurogenesis promoting effect of LBP was further confirmed in the <italic>in vitro</italic> assays, in which the corticosterone-induced proliferation inhibition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033374-Chen1">[33]</xref> was reversed by LBP. Apart from cell proliferation, LBP also promotes the neuronal differentiation of neural precursor cells as shown by DCX staining. The neurogenic effect of LBP agrees with previous findings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033374-Wen1">[34]</xref>. Interestingly, the sexual performance was found to correlate with neurogenesis. These findings provide further evidence to support the notion that the newborn neurons participate in sexual behavior. Furthermore, neurogenesis in the SVZ and hippocampus are correlated with different measurements in the sexual behavior test, which implies that SVZ neurogenesis may be intimately involved in sexual motivation (indicated by ML/IL) while both the SVZ and hippocampus are involved in copulatory performance. Further studies are required to explore this possibility and this may provide insight on the neural basis of reproductive biology.</p>
      <p>Previous studies have shown a dose-dependent response of LBP treatment on neuroprotection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033374-Chan1">[8]</xref>and sexual behavior <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033374-Luo1">[11]</xref>. We choose the current dosages (1 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg) since it was reported that the maximum therapeutic effect could be achieved by these two dosages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033374-Li1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033374-Chan1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033374-Luo1">[11]</xref>. Previous reports showed that high dose of LBP inhibited c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033374-Yu1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033374-Ho3">35</xref>, which may subsequently inhibit neural stem cell proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033374-Chen2">[36]</xref>. This may be the potential mechanism of loss of neurogenesis and sexual-enhancing effect of LBP at high dosage, while this would be confirmed in future studies.</p>
      <p>It should be noted that neurogenesis consists of different stages including cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, survival and incorporation of new neurons into the existing neural circuit <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033374-Lau1">[15]</xref>. The current study investigated the early phases including cell proliferation and differentiation, while later phases were not studied. While newly proliferated cells may act as a source of trophic factors which affect functioning of other neurons, much matured new neurons may directly involve in signal transduction. Further studies of the effect of LBP on the later phases, which may extend the treatment period to over eight weeks, may suggest its long term effect on sexual behavior of the animal from the view of neurogenesis.</p>
      <p>LBP may also modulate sexual behavior via increasing the expression of testosterone in sexually inhibited animals. Our results show that chronic corticosterone significantly suppressed the plasma level of testosterone; and thus resulting in inhibited sexual performance. Concomitance to enhancing the sexual performance, LBP also reverse the decrease in testosterone level. Similar result was found by Luo et. al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033374-Luo1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033374-Luo2">[12]</xref> that LBP increased the testosterone levels in rats subjected to castration or irradiation on testis. Alternatively, as it is recently reported that antioxidant could increase the sexual motivation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033374-Amstislavskaya1">[37]</xref>, LBP may enhance sexual behavior through its antioxidant property <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0033374-Niu1">[38]</xref>.</p>
      <p>To conclude, this study provides evidence for the pro-sexual effect of LBP in both normal animals and animals with suppressed sexual performance. Such findings support the use of wolfberry as a treatment for sexual dysfunction or as an aphrodisiac treatment. LBP could also reverse the decreased neurogenesis induced by corticosterone, which is a possible mechanism underlying its effect. Further exploration on the mechanisms would provide stronger rationale for the use of wolfberry in clinical situations. Furthermore, the effect of wolfberry on female sexual function is not yet explored. Future test of LBP on female rodent models may provide insight on the potential usage of wolfberry on treating female sexual dysfunction, such as sexual desire or arousal disorders.</p>
