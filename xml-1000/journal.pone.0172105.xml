<abstract>
<p>Estrogen, a natural immunomodulator, regulates the development and function of diverse immune cell types. There is now renewed attention on neutrophils and neutrophil serine proteases (NSPs) such as neutrophil elastase (NE), proteinase 3 (PR3), and cathepsin G (CG) in inflammation and autoimmunity. In this study, we found that although estrogen treatment significantly reduced total splenocytes number, it markedly increased the splenic neutrophil absolute numbers in estrogen-treated C57BL/6 (B6) mice when compared to placebo controls. Concomitantly, the levels of NSPs and myeloperoxidase (MPO) were highly upregulated in the splenocytes from estrogen-treated mice. Despite the critical role of NSPs in the regulation of non-infectious inflammation, by employing NE<sup>-/-</sup>/PR3<sup>-/-</sup>/CG<sup>-/-</sup> triple knock out mice, we demonstrated that the absence of NSPs affected neither estrogenâs ability to increase splenic neutrophils nor the induction of inflammatory mediators (IFNÎ³, IL-1Î², IL-6, TNFÎ±, MCP-1, and NO) from <italic>ex vivo</italic> activated splenocytes. Depletion of neutrophils <italic>in vitro</italic> in splenocytes with anti-Ly6G antibody also had no obvious effect on NSP expression or LPS-induced IFNÎ³ and MCP-1. These data suggest that estrogen augments NSPs, which appears to be independent of enhancing <italic>ex vivo</italic> inflammatory responses. Since estrogen has been implicated in regulating several experimental autoimmune diseases, we extended our observations in estrogen-treated B6 mice to spontaneous autoimmune-prone female MRL-<italic>lpr</italic>, B6-<italic>lpr</italic> and NZB/W<sub>F1</sub> mice. There was a remarkable commonality with regards to the increase of neutrophils and concomitant increase of NSPs and MPO in the splenic cells of different strains of autoimmune-prone mice and estrogen-treated B6 mice. Collectively, since NSPs and neutrophils are involved in diverse pro-inflammatory activities, these data suggest a potential pathologic implication of increased neutrophils and NSPs that merits further investigation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Estrogen has been shown to regulate the immune system of both normal and autoimmune individuals either via activation of estrogen receptor Î± (ERÎ±) and/or ERÎ² or through ER-independent mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172105.ref001">1</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172105.ref005">5</xref>]. It has been reported that <italic>in vivo</italic> estrogen exposure promotes the production of inflammatory cytokines such as interferon-gamma (IFNÎ³), Interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1Î², chemokines such as monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 and MCP-5), and inflammatory molecules such as nitric oxide (NO) in Concanavalin A (Con A) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated mouse splenic lymphoid cells and/or peritoneal macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172105.ref006">6</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172105.ref009">9</xref>]. Further, estrogen is capable of promoting B cell survival and activation or breakdown of B cell tolerance to induce lupus-related serology and pathology in non-autoimmune mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172105.ref010">10</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172105.ref013">13</xref>]. Together, these data demonstrate a pivotal role of estrogen in the regulation of T and B lymphocyte-mediated inflammation and autoimmune responses. While the regulatory role of estrogen on T and B lymphocytes is well documented, its effects on neutrophils remains largely unknown.</p>
<p>Neutrophils, a major leucocyte subset of innate immune cells, are the first line of cellular defense against invading pathogens. Neutrophils counter invading pathogens via a variety of mechanisms that include phagocytosis, respiratory burst, and recently identified NET<italic>osis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172105.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172105.ref015">15</xref>]. Neutrophil derived serine proteases (NSPs) including neutrophil elastase (NE), proteinase 3 (PR3), and cathepsin G (CG) are essential for neutrophils scavenging of infectious agents. In addition, NSPs play important roles in the regulation of non-infectious inflammatory responses via proteolytic processing of cytokines, chemokines, and signaling molecules such as NF-ÎºB and p21 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172105.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172105.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172105.ref017">17</xref>]. Furthermore, NSPs can regulate inflammation via activation of cell surface receptors such as integrins, protease-activated receptors (PARs), and toll-like receptors (TLRs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172105.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172105.ref016">16</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172105.ref018">18</xref>]. In addition to their primary role in innate immune responses and inflammation, neutrophils are also critically involved in the adaptive immune response by attracting T cells to sites of inflammation and/or by priming and engaging T cell activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172105.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172105.ref020">20</xref>].</p>
<p>Sex differences in neutrophil counts have long been observed in men and women. Women usually have higher neutrophil numbers than men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172105.ref021">21</xref>], which could, in part, contribute to stronger immune responses in women compared to men. The potential effect of estrogen on neutrophils is suggested by the observation that the neutrophil counts in women fluctuate during the menstrual cycle and that increased neutrophil percentages are associated with higher serum estradiol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172105.ref022">22</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172105.ref024">24</xref>]. To date, there is limited data with regard to estrogen effects on neutrophils and neutrophils-mediated onsite inflammatory responses. Previous studies in 1980sâ have documented that estrogen impaired hematopoiesis with decreased bone marrow cellularity, causing lymphopenia and neutropenia in estrogen-treated mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172105.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172105.ref026">26</xref>]. A later study however has shown that estrogen and its metabolites were able to stimulate granulocytic differentiation in myoblasts and induced neutrophilia in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172105.ref027">27</xref>]. Estrogen treatment was able to reduce the vascular injury response via inhibiting inflammatory mediator production and then attenuating neutrophil infiltration to injured arteries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172105.ref028">28</xref>]. However, in a different murine influenza infection model, estrogen treatment enhanced pulmonary recruitment of neutrophils to potentiate virus-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells response for virus clearance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172105.ref029">29</xref>]. This suggests that the effect of estrogen on neutrophils depends on the experimental context and tissue type.</p>
<p>In this study, we investigated the estrogen effect on neutrophils in bone marrow, blood and splenic lymphoid tissues to enable a better understanding of the potential broad tissue effects of estrogen on neutrophils. Our study clearly shows that estrogen upregulates neutrophils in the above lymphoid organs and promotes NSP expression in whole splenocytes. Abnormal expression and function of NSPs has been implicated in the pathogenesis of many chronic autoimmune inflammatory diseases including SLE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172105.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172105.ref030">30</xref>]. Nevertheless, depletion of NSPs <italic>in vivo</italic> in mice and depletion of neutrophils <italic>in vitro</italic> in splenocytes had no obvious effect on LPS induced inflammatory responses in splenocytes of estrogen-treated mice. This suggests that increased neutrophils and NSPs are not directly involved in estrogen-mediated promotion of inflammatory responses. Since estrogen has been reported to induce lupus-related autoimmune inflammatory parameters[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172105.ref010">10</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172105.ref013">13</xref>], we therefore investigated whether there are also changes of neutrophils and NSPs in the spleen of three different genetically lupus-prone murine models (MRL-<italic>lpr</italic>, B6-<italic>lpr</italic>, and NZB/W<sub>F1</sub>), which manifest varied forms of lupus and other systemic autoimmune diseases. The finding of a similar augmentation of neutrophils and NSPs in the spleens of different spontaneous murine lupus models and estrogen-treated wild-type B6 mice suggests a potential significance of estrogen upregulation of neutrophils and NSPs in autoinflammation.</p>

<title>Ethics statement and mice</title>
<p>All animal experimental procedures and housing have been approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Virginia Tech (Protocol ID# 12-131-CVM). The experimental mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation in strict accordance with approved IACUC protocol and regulations. To minimize suffering and to ensure a successful euthanasia of mice within seconds, cervical dislocation was carried out only by well-trained and approved research staff. All mice were housed in our AAALAC accredited animal facility at the Virginia-Maryland College of Veterinary Medicine (VMCVM), Virginia Tech. Mice were fed with a commercial 7013 NIH-31 Modified 6% Mouse/Rat Sterilizable Diet (Harlan Laboratory, Madison, WI, USA) and given water <italic>ad libitum</italic>.</p>
<p>Three to four week-old male C57BL/6 (B6) mice were purchased from the Charles River Laboratories, USA. The NE<sup>-/-</sup>/PR3<sup>-/-</sup>/CG<sup>-/-</sup> triple knock out (NECGPR3 deficient[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172105.ref031">31</xref>], referred as NSP<sup>-/-</sup> in the text) breeders on B6 background were kindly provided by Dr. Christine T.N. Pham from the Washington University Medical School and bred in our animal facility. Genetically autoimmune-prone female MRL/MpJ-<italic>Fas</italic><sup>lpr</sup>/J (MRL-<italic>lpr</italic>, stock No: 006825), B6.MRL-Fas<sup>lpr</sup>/J (B6-lpr, stock No: 000482), NZBWF1/J (NZB/W<sub>F1</sub>, stock No: 100008), and their respective control female MRL/MpJ (MRL, stock No: 000486), B6, and NZW/LacJ (NZW, stock No: 001058) mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory, ME, USA.

<title>Increased protease and elastase activity in splenocytes from estrogen-treated B6 mice</title>
<p>We have previously reported a serine protease mediated truncation of STAT-1 and NF-ÎºBp65 proteins in the nuclear extracts of splenocytes from estrogen-treated B6 mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172105.ref035">35</xref>], which suggested a potential regulatory effect of estrogen on serine proteases. We therefore measured the total protease activity in whole cell lysates of freshly isolated splenocytes from placebo- and estrogen-treated mice. As expected, the protease activity was significantly increased in splenocyte lysates from estrogen-treated B6 mice compared to placebo controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0172105.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). By using FLISP Serine Protease Detection Assay, we further demonstrated that there was a significantly higher chymotrypsin-like serine protease activity in living splenocytes from estrogen-treated mice when compared to placebo controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0172105.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). We then measured the specific elastase activity in splenocytes using a commercially available EnZCheck elastase assay kit. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0172105.g001">Fig 1C</xref>, the protease activity was significantly increased in splenocytes from estrogen-treated mice (without inhibitor: placebo <italic>vs</italic> estrogen). The addition of a selective elastase inhibitor, N-methoxysuccinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-chloromethylketone (100 Î¼M) significantly reduced the protease activity (estrogen: without inhibitor <italic>vs</italic> with inhibitor), suggesting a major contribution of elastase to the increased protease activity observed in splenocytes from estrogen-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0172105.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). While the selective elastase inhibitor at 100 Î¼M completely blocked the activity of the positive control (purified porcine pancreatic elastase, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0172105.g001">Fig 1D</xref>), it only partially inhibited the protease activity in splenocytes from estrogen-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0172105.g001">Fig 1C</xref>).

<title>Enhanced neutrophil serine protease expression in splenocytes from estrogen-treated B6 mice</title>
<p>While there are a variety of serine proteases produced in different immune cell types, NSPs are of particular interest because of their role in the regulation of non-infectious inflammation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172105.ref017">17</xref>]. With the finding of increased elastase activity in estrogen-treated splenocytes, we next examined whether estrogen treatment affects the expression of NE or other NSPs in splenocytes. Real-time RT-PCR analysis indicated that mRNA expression levels of all three NSPs (NE, PR3, and CG) were substantially increased in the freshly isolated splenocytes from estrogen-treated mice when compared to placebo controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0172105.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Estrogen treatment led to an over 10-fold increase in NE mRNA level and an over 80-fold increase in PR3 and CG mRNA levels in splenocytes. In accordance with increased mRNA levels, the protein expression of NSPs such as NE and PR3 were also significantly enhanced in splenocytes from estrogen-treated B6 mice when compared to placebo controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0172105.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). We were unable to analyze CG protein level in these samples because the CG antibody does not work well with our western blotting system.

<title>Depletion of splenic neutrophils <italic>in vitro</italic> has limited effect on splenic cell immune responses</title>
<p>The above data indicates that depletion of NSPs has no obvious effect on estrogen-mediated induction of inflammatory cytokines. To further understand the potential biological implication of increased neutrophils in estrogen-treated mice, we depleted splenic neutrophils <italic>in vitro</italic> with either anti-mouse Ly6G (specific for neutrophils) or anti-mouse Gr-1 (neutrophils and monocytes) antibody. As indicated, both anti-mouse Ly6G and Gr-1 efficiently depleted CD11b<sup>+</sup>Ly6G<sup>+</sup> neutrophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0172105.g007">Fig 7A</xref>) from splenocytes, but had no effect on CD4<sup>+</sup> T (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0172105.g007">Fig 7B</xref>), and CD19<sup>+</sup> B lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0172105.g007">Fig 7C</xref>). To our surprise, we found that depletion of CD11b<sup>+</sup>Ly6G<sup>+</sup> neutrophils did not significantly reduce NSP or MPO mRNA expression in the splenocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0172105.g007">Fig 7D</xref>). Also, specific depletion of Ly6G<sup>+</sup> cells did not reduce LPS-induced IFNÎ³, IL-6 and MCP-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0172105.g007">Fig 7Eâ7G</xref>). Indeed, there was a slight, but significant increase of IL-6 in either anti-Ly6G or anti-Gr-1 depleted splenocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0172105.g007">Fig 7F</xref>). However, depletion of Gr-1<sup>+</sup> cells with anti-Gr-1 antibody suppressed LPS-induced IFNÎ³ in placebo-treated splenocytes and MCP-1 in estrogen-treated splenocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0172105.g007">Fig 7E and 7G</xref>), suggesting a potential involvement of Gr-1<sup>+</sup> monocytes in LPS-induced IFNÎ³ and MCP-1 in splenocytes. Together, our data suggests that neutrophils have limited effect on LPS-induced inflammatory molecules in splenocytes from placebo- and estrogen-treated mice.</p>

<title>Increased neutrophils and NSP expression in the spleen cells of different spontaneous murine lupus models</title>
<p>Since estrogen is known to regulate autoimmune diseases, we extended our studies to determine whether similar changes to neutrophil numbers and NSPs are also evident in several strains of autoimmune-prone mice. Analogous to our observation in the estrogen-induced murine inflammation model, there was a significant increase in neutrophil percentage in the spleens of autoimmune-prone female MRL-<italic>lpr</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0172105.g008">Fig 8A</xref>), B6-<italic>lpr</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0172105.g008">Fig 8B</xref>), and NZB/W<sub>F1</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0172105.g008">Fig 8C</xref>) when compared to their respective control female MRL, B6, and NZW mice. However, unlike estrogen-treated B6 mice, there was no increase of neutrophils in the blood and bone marrow of above three strains of autoimmune-prone mice (data not shown). Consistent with increased neutrophil percentage, there were also increased NSP and MPO mRNA expression levels in the splenocytes from MRL-<italic>lpr</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0172105.g008">Fig 8D</xref>), B6-<italic>lpr</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0172105.g008">Fig 8E</xref>) and NZB/W<sub>F1</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0172105.g008">Fig 8F</xref>) when compared to their respective controls.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>There is now a wealth of data indicating that estrogen regulates the development and functions of T cell subsets (Th1, Th2, Treg) and B cell subsets (B1 and B2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172105.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172105.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172105.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172105.ref037">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172105.ref038">38</xref>]. Estrogen is also known to regulate the development, differentiation and functions of dendritic cells, macrophages and monocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172105.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172105.ref039">39</xref>]. However, the data with regards to the regulatory effect of estrogen on neutrophils are limited.</p>
<p>Neutrophils have a short life span and therefore are constantly replenished from bone marrow. The sex differences in neutrophil numbers suggest a potential regulatory role of sex hormones such as estrogen. Studies in humans have shown neutrophilia in pregnant women correlated with increased levels of progesterone and estrogen throughout pregnancy[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172105.ref023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172105.ref040">40</xref>]. Moreover, increased neutrophil numbers were also seen in cancer patients who received estramustine phosphate chemotherapy treatment, which elevates serum 17-Î² estradiol level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172105.ref041">41</xref>]. Nevertheless, in one older murine study, estrogen appeared to have suppressive effects on hematopoiesis and granulopoiesis, since administration of estrogen blocked the increase of circulating lymphocytes, neutrophils, and monocytes in ovariectomized mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172105.ref042">42</xref>]. Together, these data suggest a regulatory effect of estrogen on neutrophils. Here, we report an increase in neutrophil percentages in the primary lymphoid organ bone marrow, peripheral blood and in the secondary lymphoid organ spleen in <italic>in vivo</italic> estrogen-treated B6 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0172105.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Despite a reduction of total splenic cellularity, the absolute splenic neutrophil counts were increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0172105.g003">Fig 3E</xref>), in addition to increased percentage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0172105.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). Since 7â8 wks of estrogen implant treatment in mice causes osteopetrosis and diminishes the bone marrow cavity, we were unable to recover all the bone marrow cells from estrogen-treated mice to ascertain the absolute number of bone marrow neutrophils. The precise reasons for estrogen-mediated increase in splenic neutrophils remains unclear. It is plausible that estrogen treatment stimulates splenic lymphoid cells to secrete neutrophil attracting chemokines or promotes localized development and/or survival of neutrophils. This hypothesis is supported by the reports that estrogen promotes the production of neutrophil-attracting chemokine MCP-1 in splenocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172105.ref008">8</xref>] and that estrogen delays spontaneous neutrophil apoptosis to induce neutrophilia in pregnant women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172105.ref040">40</xref>]. Further, although the mice appeared healthy after estrogen treatment, we cannot rule out the possibility that estrogen may causes an undetermined endogenous infection that enhanced neutrophil numbers and activities. We have initially utilized anti-CD11b and anti-GR-1 antibodies to identify neutrophils in this study. Since Gr-1 also labels Ly6C on eosinophils and monocytes, we later used anti-CD11b and a specific anti-Ly6G antibody to confirm the increase of neutrophils (CD11b<sup>+</sup>Ly6G<sup>+</sup>) in the spleens of estrogen-treated B6 mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0172105.s001">S1 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>In agreement with the increase in neutrophil counts in splenocytes of estrogen-treated mice, we observed an increase in NSPs and neutrophil specific MPO expression (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0172105.g002">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0172105.g003">3</xref>). The increase in NSP expression is not simply due to increased neutrophil counts in the spleen since depletion of neutrophils <italic>in vitro</italic> from splenocytes did not reduce NSP expression levels. We also analyzed NSP expression in both purified CD11b<sup>+</sup> myeloid cells and CD90.2<sup>+</sup> T cells from placebo- and estrogen-treated B6 mice. We found that estrogen-treatment increased NSPs and MPO mRNA expression not only in CD11b<sup>+</sup> myeloid cells, but also in CD90.2<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0172105.s002">S2AâS2D Fig</xref>). The increase of NE and MPO mRNA expression was also observed in purified splenic CD4<sup>+</sup> T and CD19<sup>+</sup> B cells from MRL-<italic>lpr</italic> mice when compared to that from control MRL mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0172105.s002">S2E and S2F Fig</xref>). Further investigation is necessary to determine the functionality of the NSPs in T cells.</p>
<p>Both estrogen receptor (ER)Î± and ERÎ² are expressed in neutrophils and regulate neutrophil functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172105.ref023">23</xref>]. It has been reported that ERÎ± plays an essential role in estrogen-mediated regulation of inflammatory responses in different immune cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172105.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172105.ref043">43</xref>]. Due to an unexpected loss of ERÎ±<sup>-/-</sup> mice during the estrogen treatment, we can only draw limited conclusions from the reduced number of surviving estrogen-treated ERÎ±<sup>-/-</sup> knock out mice study. Consistent with previous reports, our limited data indicate that depletion of ERÎ± abolished the positive effect of estrogen on the induction of inflammatory molecules such as NO (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0172105.s003">S3A Fig</xref>), iNOS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0172105.s003">S3B Fig</xref>), and MCP-1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0172105.s003">S3C Fig</xref>) in activated splenocytes. Moreover, depletion of ERÎ± eliminated estrogen-mediated upregulation of NSPs in the spleen (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0172105.s003">S3D Fig</xref>). This data is suggestive of the involvement of ERÎ± in estrogen-mediated promotion of inflammation and NSPs in splenocytes, with the caveat that the limited number of estrogen-treated ERÎ±<sup>-/-</sup> mice preclude drawing firm conclusions.</p>
<p>Previous studies have shown that the absence of NSPs led to defective onsite cytokine production <italic>in vivo</italic> in various models of inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172105.ref036">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172105.ref044">44</xref>]. However, NSP deficient neutrophils showed no defect in cytokine/chemokine production when directly stimulated <italic>in vitro</italic> with PMA or LPS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0172105.ref045">45</xref>]. Similarly, we noted that there were no differences in the production of inflammatory mediators (IFNÎ³, IL-1Î², IL-6, TNFÎ±, MCP-1 and iNOS/NO) between LPS-activated wild type B6 and NSP<sup>-/-</sup> splenocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0172105.g005">Fig 5</xref>). Estrogen treatment promoted inflammatory responses in activated NSP<sup>-/-</sup> splenocytes similar to that noted in wild type B6 mice splenocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0172105.g005">Fig 5</xref>). These data suggest that the <italic>ex vivo</italic> promotion of aforementioned inflammatory molecules by estrogen in splenocytes might be mediated through NSP-independent mechanisms.</p>
<p>Depletion of neutrophils specifically with anti-mouse Ly6G antibody <italic>in vitro</italic> from splenocytes did not have an obvious effect on LPS-induced immune responses in splenocytes, while depletion of both neutrophils and Gr-1<sup>+</sup> monocytes with anti-mouse Gr-1 antibody had a suppressive effect on LPS-induced IFNÎ³ and MCP-1. Remarkably, depletion of neutrophils also did not affect the expression of NSP mRNAs suggesting that other cells may contribute to NSP synthesis. In support of this view, we noticed that estrogen promoted NSPs in T lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0172105.s002">S2 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Although the direct functional relevance of increased neutrophil counts and NSP expression in splenic cells in estrogen-mediated promotion of inflammation remains unknown, the similar upregulation of splenic neutrophils and NSPs in estrogen-treated B6 mice and in spontaneous autoimmune-prone murine models implicates a potential significance of neutrophils in estrogen mediated autoinflammatory responses. Together, our studies provide new information about the role of estrogen in neutrophils and NSPs, which bear remarkable similarity to that noticed in several autoimmune prone female mice. The precise contribution of altered neutrophils and NSPs to the activity of other defined splenic cell subsets warrants further investigation in future studies, which shall provide new perspective for understanding the cellular mechanism of estrogen regulation of inflammation and autoimmunity.</p>
