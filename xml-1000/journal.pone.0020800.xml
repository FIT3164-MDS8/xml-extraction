        <p>The 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptor remains one of the less well characterized
                    serotonin receptors. Although it has been demonstrated to be involved in the
                    regulation of mood, sleep, and circadian rhythms, as well as relaxation of
                    vascular smooth muscles in mammals, the precise mechanisms underlying these
                    functions remain largely unknown. The fruit fly, <italic>Drosophila
                        melanogaster</italic>, is an attractive model organism to study
                    neuropharmacological, molecular, and behavioral processes that are largely
                    conserved with mammals. Drosophila express a homolog of the mammalian
                        5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptor, as well as homologs for the mammalian
                        5-HT<sub>1A</sub>, and 5-HT<sub>2</sub>, receptors. Each fly receptor
                    couples to the same effector pathway as their mammalian counterpart and have
                    been demonstrated to mediate similar behavioral responses. Here, we report on
                    the expression and function of the 5-HT<sub>7</sub>Dro receptor in Drosophila.
                    In the larval central nervous system, expression is detected postsynaptically in
                    discreet cells and neuronal circuits. In the adult brain there is strong
                    expression in all large-field R neurons that innervate the ellipsoid body, as
                    well as in a small group of cells that cluster with the PDF-positive LNvs
                    neurons that mediate circadian activity. Following both pharmacological and
                    genetic approaches, we have found that 5-HT<sub>7</sub>Dro activity is essential
                    for normal courtship and mating behaviors in the fly, where it appears to
                    mediate levels of interest in both males and females. This is the first reported
                    evidence of direct involvement of a particular serotonin receptor subtype in
                    courtship and mating in the fly.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Serotonin (5-HT) is a monoamine neurotransmitter that regulates a variety of
                behaviors and physiological processes including circadian rhythms, sleep, appetite,
                aggression, locomotion, perception and sexual behavior in mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020800-Breier1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020800-Lucki1">[2]</xref>. In mammals,
                there are fourteen different receptors than can be organized into seven families.
                The many effects of serotonin are primarily mediated through G-protein coupled
                receptors, which initiate multiple effector pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020800-Nichols1">[3]</xref>. Misregulation of serotonin
                signaling in humans has been implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders including
                depression, anxiety, anorexia nervosa, and schizophrenia.</p>
      <p>In mammals, 5-HT<sub>7</sub> mRNA has been observed in both the CNS and peripheral
                tissues including the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus, thalamus,
                hippocampus and cortex, as well as coronary artery, gastrointestinal tract, kidney,
                and spleen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020800-Nichols1">[3]</xref>.
                    5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptors are expressed postsynaptically in the cortex,
                hippocampal formation and other parts of the brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020800-Neumaier1">[4]</xref>. They are, however, found both
                pre- and postsynaptically in the SCN <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020800-Belenky1">[5]</xref>. Studies using antagonists and
                a knock out mouse model show involvement of 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptor activity in
                regulating mood, sleep, and circadian rhythms, as well as relaxation of vascular
                smooth muscles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020800-Guscott1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020800-Guscott2">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020800-Hedlund1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020800-Hedlund2">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020800-Janssen1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020800-Monti1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020800-Monti2">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020800-Sprouse1">[13]</xref>. With regard to sleep, 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptors
                modulate neuronal function in a number of areas of the brain that have been
                implicated in this behavior, including the SCN, DRN, thalamus and hippocampus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020800-Thomas1">[14]</xref>. The systemic
                administration of 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptor antagonist to rats at the beginning of
                light periods reduces total amount of REM sleep, and direct administration of
                antagonist into the DRN reduces REM sleep and the number of REM sleep periods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020800-Monti1">[11]</xref>. Interestingly,
                    5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptors have also been implicated in the regulation of
                mammalian sexual behavior. Activation of this receptor in rats mediates an
                inhibitory effect of female sexual behavior <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020800-Siddiqui1">[15]</xref>.</p>
      <p><italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (the fruit fly) has proven to be a very
                effective model system for investigating the function of mammalian systems and
                diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020800-Pandey1">[16]</xref>.
                About 70% of human disease genes have functional orthologs in Drosophila
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020800-Bier1">[17]</xref>, and the
                fly expresses functional orthologs of most mammalian neurotransmitter receptors,
                including receptors for dopamine, glutamate, acetylcholine, GABA, and serotonin,
                which mediate conserved behaviors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020800-Nichols2">[18]</xref>. The fruit fly expresses orthologs of three of the seven
                mammalian receptor families: 5-HT<sub>1A/B</sub>Dro, 5-HT<sub>2</sub>Dro and
                    5-HT<sub>7</sub>Dro, and the molecular pathways linking serotonin receptor
                interactions with behaviors are likely to be conserved between the two systems.
                    5-HT<sub>1A/B</sub>Dro are expressed in adult mushroom bodies, as well as
                additional brain circuits (unpublished data; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020800-Yuan1">[19]</xref>), and mediate aspects of sleep
                and aggression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020800-Yuan1">[19]</xref>,
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020800-Johnson1">[20]</xref>. We have
                previously characterized the 5-HT<sub>2</sub>Dro receptor, and found that it is
                expressed throughout the adult brain, including neurons within the protocerebrum and
                ellipsoid body, and mediates aspects of circadian behaviors and aggression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020800-Johnson1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020800-Nichols3">[21]</xref>. Here, we
                report on expression and function of the 5-HT<sub>7</sub>Dro receptor in
                    <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. It is expressed within discreet
                circuits in the brain and ventral nerve cord, and is essential for normal courtship
                and mating.</p>

        <p>Fly strains obtained from other sources were Canton-S (CS), and UAS-mCD8::GFP
                    (Bloomington Stock Center, Bloomington, IN). For routine maintenance, flies were
                    reared on standard cornmeal-molasses food at 25Â°C under 12 hour light/dark

        <p>For the mating assays, bottles of wild type CS flies were cleared and newly
                    eclosed, virgin females and males were collected and matured for 5-6 days prior
                    to testing in 15 mL conical tubes containing â¼300 ÂµL of food
                    (10% sucrose, 1% agarose and the appropriate drug) and plugged
                    with cotton at the open end. In the courtship and mating assays, flies were
                    maintained on food + drug for 5 days to ensure that steady-state levels
                    were reached. To determine if the presence of SB258719 affected the feeding
                    behaviors of the flies, a CAFÃ assay was performed following established
                    protocols <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020800-Ja1">[22]</xref> and
                    feeding a 10% sucrose solution with or without 3 mM SB258719. No
                    statistical differences were observed in the feeding behaviors between the two

                    until testing. Following the maturation period, one male and one female were
                    transferred to a single chamber of a mating wheel. The mating wheel is a

        <title>The 5-HT<sub>7</sub>Dro receptor is expressed in the larval and adult

        <p>Heterozygous flies carrying both the 5-HT<sub>7</sub>Dro-GAL4 and UAS-mCD8::GFP
                    constructs were used to examine the expression patterns of the
                    5-HT<sub>7</sub>Dro-GAL4 element. GFP expression, representing putative
                        5-HT<sub>7</sub>Dro expression, is observed in discreet populations of cells
                    in the hemispheres of the 3<sup>rd</sup> instar larva brain, as well as in
                    neurons in the ventral ganglia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020800-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Two independent insertion lines produced identical
                    expression patterns, two produced no expression, and one strain was lost before
                    expressing testing could be completed. The parental homozygous UAS-mCD8::GFP
                    responder strains did not demonstrate any detectable expression (data not
                    shown). To determine if 5-HT<sub>7</sub>Dro expression is pre- or post-synaptic,
                    immunohistochemistry was performed with anti-serotonin antibodies.
                        5-HT<sub>7</sub>Dro-GFP expression in the larvae brain does not co-localize

        <p>In the adult brain, 5-HT<sub>7</sub>Dro-GFP is expressed at high levels in
                    large-field R neurons that innervate the ellipsoid body, and within discreet
                    populations of cells between the central brain and the optic lobes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020800-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). The location of
                    the small cluster of 5-HT<sub>7</sub>Dro-mCD8 expressing cells between the
                    central brain and the optic lobe are reminiscent of the location of PDF (peptide
                    dispersing factor)-expressing sLNvs and lLNvs described in Helfrich-Forster
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020800-HelfrichForster1">[30]</xref> that are members of the circadian clock circuitry. To
                    determine if these are indeed PDF-expressing clock neurons, we co-stained with
                    anti-PDF antibodies, and revealed that whereas 5-HT<sub>7</sub>Dro-GAL4
                    expressing neurons are not the PDF neurons, they tightly cluster with the
                    PDF-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020800-g003">Figure
                        3A</xref> inset). This clustering suggests that 5-HT<sub>7</sub>Dro neurons
                    may modulate or influence the function of the PDF-positive LNvs, and may have a
                    role in circadian behaviors. A close inspection of the cluster of large-field R
                    neurons within the central complex reveals 5-HT<sub>7</sub>Dro-GAL4 expression
                    in greater than 40 large neurons of each cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020800-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Their neurites run in a tract to
                    the lateral triangle and thereafter to the ellipsoid body. Previously described
                    ring neurons have their cell bodies in this area <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020800-Renn1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020800-Young1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020800-Hanesch1">[33]</xref>. Interestingly, as
                    exemplified by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020800-g003">Figure 3B</xref>, we
                    detect more large-field R neurons per cluster than previously reported (â¼48
                    per cluster). Previous studies utilizing GAL4 drivers to highlight various
                    subpopulations of large-field R neurons have only indicated the presence of
                    38â40 neurons per cluster <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020800-Renn1">[31]</xref>. Our results suggest that not only does the
                        5-HT<sub>7</sub>Dro-GAL4 driver likely express in all known large-field
                    R-neurons, but that there may be additional yet to be defined subpopulations of
                    neurons within the clusters. Very weak 5-HT<sub>7</sub>Dro-Gal4 expression in
                    the upper region of the fan-shaped body, but not in other substructures of the

        <p>We performed serotonin-immunolabeling on brains of adult flies expressing
                        5-HT<sub>7</sub>Dro-GAL4 driven GFP to study spatial relations between
                    ligand and receptor. Whereas the distribution of serotonin-immunoreactive
                    neuronal processes is abundant throughout most of the major brain neuropils,
                        5-HT<sub>7</sub>Dro-GAL4 mediated GFP expression is most prominent in part
                    of the central complex and in the antennal lobe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020800-g004">Figure 4A</xref>i). In the central complex
                    serotonin-immunoreactive processes can be seen in the fan-shaped body and
                    ellipsoid body, as well as in the lateral triangles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020800-g004">Figure 4Aii</xref>). Both serotonin-immunolabeling
                    and 5-HT<sub>7</sub>Dro-GAL4 expression is seen in the anterior and posterior
                    rings of the ellipsoid body and in the lateral triangles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020800-g004">Figure 4</xref>). The neural processes seen with the

                        B</xref> the large cell bodies of the serotonergic antennal lobe neurons do
                    not coexpress 5-HT<sub>7</sub>Dro-GAL4. This GAL4 expression in the antennal
                    lobes is weak, but enhancement of the GFP signal reveals a large interneuron in
                    each hemisphere that supply branches to the glomeruli that is distinct from the
                    serotonergic interneuron (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0020800.s001">Fig. S1 C, D</xref>). In general, serotonergic
                    processes are far more abundantly distributed than those of the
                    5-HT<sub>7</sub>Dro-GAL4 expressing neurons, suggesting that serotonin acts via
                    other 5-HT receptors in most parts of the brain.</p>
        <p>Expression of 5-HT<sub>7</sub>Dro-GAL4 is also detected in several neurons in the
                    ventral ganglion of the adult. The Gal4-driven GFP was seen in paired neurons in
                    all thoracic and abdominal neuromeres of the ganglion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020800-g005">Fig. 5A, B</xref>). In each of the meso and
                    metathoracic neuromeres there are two pair of neurons with large lateral cell
                    bodies displaying GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020800-g005">Fig.

                    in each neuromere. In abdominal neuromeres larger and smaller
                    5-HT<sub>7</sub>Dro-expressing cell bodies were distributed without a strict
                    segmental organization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020800-g005">Fig. 5A,
                        E</xref>). Altogether we could detect approximately 40 neuronal cell bodies
                    in the thoracic neuromeres and about 30 in the abdominal. GFP labeled neuronal
                    processes were seen in neuropil of the different neuromeres, some were organized
                    in distinct tracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020800-g005">Fig.

                    expressing ganglia we could show that the two markers are not colocalized in any
                    neuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020800-g005">Fig. 5D, E</xref>),
                    suggesting post-synaptic distribution of the receptor. The
                    serotonin-immunoreactive processes are very abundant in thoracic and abdominal
                    neuropils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020800-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>) and
                    double labeling revealed superposition of these and the branches of

                    the receptor in courtship, as described next, we also examined
                    5-HT<sub>7</sub>Dro-GAL4 expression in relation to the male form of Fruitless
                        (Fru<sup>M</sup>), a key protein involved in sexual behaviors. We did not

                    mating behavior</title>
        <p>In Drosophila, complex behaviors such as learning and memory, aggression,
                    locomotor reactivity, circadian rhythm, olfaction, and sleep are mediated by
                    higher brain centers such as the mushroom body, ellipsoid body, and central
                    complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020800-HelfrichForster1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020800-HelfrichForster2">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020800-Rollmann1">[39]</xref>. The
                    mushroom body has been implicated in Drosophila courtship and mating behavior

                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020800-Popov1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020800-Yamamoto1">[42]</xref>, however,
                    the precise role of the ellipsoid body, and other components of the central
                    complex has yet to be explored.</p>
        <p>The effects of the 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptor antagonist, SB258719 (SB), on
                    courtship behavior were assessed after maintaining flies for five days on food
                    containing various amounts of drug ranging from 0.01 mM to 3.0 mM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020800-g006">Figures 6 A-L</xref>). SB258719 is
                    approximately 100 fold more selective for the 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptor than
                    other 5-HT receptors in mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020800-Thomas2">[43]</xref>, however the specificity for the drug at Drosophila
                    receptors has not yet been defined. Courtship pairs were assayed for orient
                    latency, wing vibration latency, lick latency, curl latency, copulation
                    attempts, copulation latency, and copulation duration, as well as frequencies
                    for each behavior. Whereas the frequencies of behaviors were observed to
                    generally decrease with increasing drug, the latencies of flies still performing
                    a particular behavior at any given drug level were not significantly different
                    from that of controls with the exception of wing song and licking latencies at
                    3.0 mM SB, which were about double that of control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020800-g006">Figure 6 B, C</xref>). All pairs for a given
                    treatment exhibited normal orienting behavior except for pairs fed 3.0 mM SB,
                    where only 8 of 10 pairs exhibited this behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020800-g006">Figure 6H</xref>). All pairs also demonstrated wing
                    vibration at all drug levels except for 1.0 and 3.0 mM SB fed pairs, where only
                    8 of 10 pairs exhibited this behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020800-g006">Figure 6I</xref>). These relatively normal early
                    behaviors of courtship in flies fed higher levels of SB indicate that sensory
                    processes are not likely being disrupted by the SB antagonist. If they were, the
                    fly would not be expected to perform normally behaviors that rely upon visual,
                    auditory, taste, or olfactory sensory cues.</p>

            <p>Mating pairs fed increasing amounts of the antagonist SB285719 (black
                            bars) were observed for ten minutes to assay the latency of orient, wing
                            vibration, licking, and curling (A, B, C, D, F), the number of
                            copulation attempts (E), the duration of copulation (G), and the
                            frequency at which each behavior occurs (H-L). The latencies of
                            SB-treated flies performing a specific behavior did not differ
                            significantly from untreated controls (gray bars) with increasing drug
                            doses (A, B, C, D, F) with the exception of curling and licking at 3 mM.
                            The number or copulation attempts (E) were significantly decreased at
                            doses above 0.7 mM, while the frequency of attempted copulations
                            decreased with doses above 0.05 mM. Whereas flies fed doses of SB
                            greater than 0.07 mM did not successfully copulate (F, L), the duration
                            of successful copulations at lower doses did not differ from controls
                            (G). (nâ=â10 pairs observed for each behavior;

                            period. Number of beam breaks per hour were counted and averaged over a
                            three-day period. SB-treated flies exhibited only a slight increase in
                            levels of activity compared to control flies.</p>

        <p>Decreases in licking frequency were observed at levels greater than 0.5 mM SB,

                    were significantly reduced in pairs treated with 0.7, 1.0, and 3.0 mM drug
                        (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020800-g006">Figure 6E</xref>), and the

                    only flies fed drug at or below 0.07 mM successfully copulated, with an
                        IC<sub>50</sub>â=â0.05 mM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020800-g006">Figure 6L</xref>). The latencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020800-g006">Figure 6F</xref>) and durations

                    pairs of flies that successfully copulated were not significantly different from
                    that of controls, however, these behaviors were observed in fewer pairs as drug
                    concentrations were increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020800-g006">Figure 6L</xref>). To determine if the observed effects of the SB drug were
                    simply due to drug-induced decreases in activity levels, general activity was
                    measured using the Trikinetics DAMS system. SB treated flies were observed to be
                    only slightly more active than untreated control flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020800-g006">Figure 6M</xref>).</p>
        <p>To determine if the observed impairments in mating behavior in SB treated flies
                    were due to dysfunction in the male, the female, or both, SB fed females were
                    paired with control males, and SB fed males and control females were paired. We
                    chose a dose of 3.0 mM to test, because this dose produced a maximal effect
                    across all behaviors. In the SB female and control male pairs, orient, wing
                    vibration, and lick, latencies were significantly increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020800-g007">Figures 7 Aâ4C</xref>).
                    Interestingly, curl latencies were significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020800-g007">Figure 7D</xref>). Copulation attempts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020800-g007">Figure 7E</xref>) were also
                    significantly reduced in these pairs. The frequencies at which these behaviors
                    were observed decreased as well compared to control (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0020800-t001">Table 1</xref>). Whereas orient and wing vibration
                    frequencies were only slightly decreased, curl and copulation frequencies were
                    dramatically reduced or eliminated.</p>

                    receptors may serve to modulate courtship and mating behaviors in both male and
                    females flies. There were some differences observed between these experiments
                    where only one fly was fed SB, and those where both the male and female have
                    been maintained on drug. Specifically, the performance of the SB male flies in
                    the SB male + control were reduced compared to the results of pairs where
                    both flies were exposed to drug. This could be due to differences in the
                    dynamics of the interactions between the male and female when only one partner
                    has been exposed to drug. For example, when both partners have been exposed, the
                    general lack of interest in courtship parallel each other, but there was no
                    active avoidance of one fly from the other. In contrast, when only the males
                    have been exposed, the males were never interested in the females, and tended to
                    stay clear of the females, and generally were never in the same vicinity of the
                    females. Furthermore, there were some instances where the females seemed to seek
                    the male and the male would run away from the female. When only the female was
                    exposed to drug, the male vigorously attempted to court. Whereas these female
                    did not exhibit overtly obvious actions to reject the male, such us wing
                    flicking, they generally avoided contact with the male.</p>
        <p>Serotonin has previously been implicated in courtship behaviors, specifically
                    male-male courtship. For example, ectopic expression of the <italic>white
                            (w<sup>+</sup>)</italic> gene, which encodes for the transporter
                    for tryptophan (the metabolic precursor for serotonin) has been shown to lead to
                    inter-male courtship <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020800-Zhang1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020800-Hing1">[45]</xref>. To determine if SB treatment affected male-male
                    courtship, in addition to normal male-female courtship, we examined interactions
                    between pairs of males fed SB. Control pairs only exhibited minimal male-male
                    courtship behaviors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0020800.s002">Figure S2</xref>). No significant changes in the
                    courtship index (CI; the time engaged in all courtship behaviors divided by the
                    total time of the assay) in SB-treated males in comparison to untreated controls
                    were detected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0020800.s003">Figure S3</xref>).</p>

        <p>Pharmacological and genetic knockdown experiments can provide complementary data
                    regarding the function of a receptor. With pharmacological studies we have
                    measured the effect of different levels of inactivation using different doses of
                    antagonist to show that 5-HT<sub>7</sub>Dro receptor function is potentially
                    required more at the later stages of courtship than the earlier stages. In order
                    to validate our pharmacological results, we created a UAS-dsRNA strain to knock
                    down 5-HT<sub>7</sub>Dro mRNA expression. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed to
                    examine the levels of 5-HT<sub>7</sub>Dro transcript in F1 flies carrying both
                    the 5-HT<sub>7</sub>Dro-GAL4 and the UAS-sym-p5-HT<sub>7</sub>RNAi. Flies
                    carrying both transgenes show an approximately 80% decrease in transcript
                    levels when compared to flies carrying only one trangene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020800-g008">Figure 8</xref>).</p>

        <p>If the pharmacological agents (e.g. the SB antagonists) were specifically acting
                    at 5-HT<sub>7</sub>Dro receptors, as anticipated, then knockdown of
                        5-HT<sub>7</sub>Dro mRNA in putative 5-HT<sub>7</sub>Dro expressing cells
                    would be anticipated to recapitulate major aspects of the behavioral phenotypes
                    of the antagonist. Indeed, expression of double-stranded 5-HT<sub>7</sub>Dro
                    mRNA in cells defined by our 5-HT<sub>7</sub>Dro-GAL4 driver produced courting
                    and mating deficits consistent with the antagonist studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020800-g009">Figure 9</xref>). Early behaviors like orienting and
                    wing vibration were not significantly affected, whereas later behaviors like
                    curling and copulation attempts were significantly reduced, with later events

      <p>To explore the role of the 5-HT<sub>7</sub>Dro receptor in the fly, we have created
                an enhancer GAL4 driver strain and used it to characterized the putative CNS
                expression and function of the receptor. Using our 5-HT<sub>7</sub>Dro-GAL4 driver
                to drive expression of a UAS-mCD8::GFP transgene, we have found GFP expression in
                third larval instar brain localized to discreet circuits within the brain
                hemispheres, as well as to specific neurons in the ventral ganglion. In the adult
                brain, there is a high level of 5-HT<sub>7</sub>Dro-GAL4 expression in large-field R
                neurons that innervate the ellipsoid body, as well as in neurons in the brain that
                tightly cluster with the PDF-positive LNv clock neurons and innervate the optic
                lobes. There is moderate expression detected in the olfactory and gustatory regions
                of the brain, and weak expression in other central complex structures like the fan
                shaped body. 5-HT<sub>7</sub>Dro-GAL4 expression appears to be post-synaptic both in
                larvae and adults. This is consistent with the observed post-synaptic expression for
                the 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptor in vertebrate CNS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020800-Neumaier1">[4]</xref>. In the ventral nerve cord,
                expression is detected in several sets of postsynaptic neurons and in all neuromeres
                of the fused ganglion. Importantly, there is a close apposition between
                receptor-expressing processes and those containing serotonin. Although a majority of
                GAL4 driver strains present relevant/accurate expression data of the intended gene
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020800-Bellen1">[46]</xref>, It
                should be emphasized here that 5-HT<sub>7</sub>Dro-GAL4 enhancer expression may not
                represent the entire expression pattern of the native 5-HT<sub>7</sub>Dro receptor,
                or may be even expressing in cells that do not express the native receptor. It
                should also be emphasized that the mCD8:GFP construct we used in this study to
                examine expression is a membrane-bound form of the GFP protein that highlights all
                cellular membranes. Whereas the GFP expression patterns observed here provide clues
                as to the cells and structures that express the 5-HT<sub>7</sub>Dro-GAL4 element, it
                is unable to provide information regarding the subcellular localization of the GPCR
                on the cellular membrane. Unfortunately, our attempts to generate anti-sera to
                    5-HT<sub>7</sub>Dro for further validation of native protein expression were
                unsuccessful.</p>
      <p>Treatment with the 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptor antagonist SB258719 interferes with
                courtship and mating behaviors. Interestingly, the IC<sub>50</sub> values for
                inhibition of courtship behavior frequency decreases as the courtship and mating
                process progresses from hardly any disruptive effect with respect to early behaviors
                involving sensory cues (orient and wing vibration), to more pronounced effects for
                intermediate behaviors (licking, curling, attempts), to complete loss of successful
                copulation at higher levels of the drug. In corroboration with the pharmacological
                studies, knockdown of 5-HT<sub>7</sub>Dro message within 5-HT<sub>7</sub>Dro-GAL4
                expressing neurons produces behavioral changes consistent with our pharmacological
                results. The early behaviors of orientation and wing song are not affected much, the
                intermediate behaviors of licking and curling are significantly disrupted, and
                successful copulation is eliminated. There are some subtle differences between
                methods, however, like for curling latencies, which could be due to the nature of
                receptor inactivation (more acute pharmacological methods <italic>vs</italic>.
                constitutive nature of the RNAi knockdown).</p>
      <p>From our results, there appears to be little 5-HT<sub>7</sub>Dro receptor involvement
                in the early stages, where we observed that antagonist treated males are receptive
                to females present in the mating chamber, and are able to initiate the first
                elements of the mating process. During the intermediate stages, involving licking
                and curling, there is likely more involvement of 5-HT<sub>7</sub>Dro receptor
                signaling. A decrease in licking behavior may result in decreased curling, and
                decreased curling may result in decreased successful copulation attempts, with the
                effects compounding at each successive behavior leading to an overall failure at
                successful copulation. These effects could arise from alterations in physical
                performance and coordination, sensory perception, olfaction, or to decreases in
                receptivity or interest, or a lack of âmotivationâ to perform the higher
                intensity physical behaviors. We believe these effects are not due to deficits in
                overt locomotor activity because the drug treated flies demonstrate normal levels of
                measured activity, or in coordination because at drug levels where mating frequency
                is decreased the flies that do perform, perform well with latencies not
                significantly different than control pairs. General alteration of sensory perception
                is also not a likely reason because males recognize females and readily perform
                behaviors related to visual and acoustic cues (orienting and wing vibration) despite
                administration of antagonist or knockdown of message. Whereas olfaction is necessary
                for receptivity, it is unlikely impeded following antagonist administration because
                flies fed 3 mM SB as well as the knockdown flies exhibit normal aversion and
                sensitivity to odors in olfactory tests. Nevertheless, there still may be an
                olfactory or pheromone component if the limited 5-HT<sub>7</sub>Dro-GAL4 expression
                detected in the olfactory lobes correlates with select neurons necessary for
                reception of specific courtship related pheromones, or the expression does not
                correlate appropriately with native 5-HT<sub>7</sub>Dro expression and localization
                in the olfactory lobes.</p>
      <p>A key gene known to be significantly involved in courtship behaviors is
                    <italic>fruitless</italic> (<italic>fru</italic>), where almost every stage of
                the mating process has been shown to be disrupted by certain alleles of the locus
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020800-Villella1">[47]</xref>. With
                the exception of one <italic>fru</italic> allele, <italic>satori,</italic> where
                males exclusively courts males, <italic>fru</italic> mutants indiscriminately court
                both males and females <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020800-Billeter2">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020800-Ito1">[49]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020800-Yamamoto2">[50]</xref>. In Drosophila, there are also several other known
                mutants that rarely court females or males. These include <italic>he's not
                    interested</italic> (<italic>hni</italic>), <italic>tapered</italic>
                    (<italic>ta</italic>), <italic>pale</italic>, <italic>cuckold</italic>
                    (<italic>cuc</italic>) and <italic>courtless</italic> (<italic>crl</italic>)
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020800-Yamamoto3">[51]</xref>. Two of
                these genes have been characterized: <italic>courtless</italic> encodes a
                ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme that is also involved in spermatogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020800-Orgad1">[52]</xref>, and
                    <italic>pale</italic> encodes a tyrosine hydroxylase that catalyzes the
                synthesis of dopamine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020800-Buchner1">[53]</xref>. In our experiments with both the 5-HT<sub>7</sub>
                receptor antagonist and the RNAi knockdown, male flies displayed a general
                disinterest in mating with either females or other males, and females appeared
                non-responsive to male courtship attempts.</p>
      <p>Ectopic expression of the <italic>white</italic> gene, which encodes for the
                transporter for the biosynthetic precursor of serotonin, tryptophan, can induce
                inter-male courtship <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020800-Zhang1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020800-Hing1">[45]</xref>. These observations, along with others, suggested that
                serotonin may be involved in courtship in the fly (interestingly, alterations in
                5-HT levels have been shown to elicit homosexual behavior in mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020800-Fratta1">[54]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020800-Gessa1">[55]</xref>). In early
                studies examining co-expression of the male-specific Fru<sup>M</sup> protein and
                5-HT, it was found that in wild-type males there were no 5-HT CNS neurons that
                co-expressed Fru<sup>M</sup>, with the exception of a small cluster of serotonergic
                cells at the posterior tip of the ventral nerve cord <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020800-Lee2">[37]</xref>. The possibility, however, still
                remained that perhaps Fru<sup>M</sup> expression was mediating the effects of
                serotonin postsynaptically. Our results have shown there is no overlap between
                    Fru<sup>M</sup> and 5-HT<sub>7</sub>Dro-GAL4 expression. Therefore, it would
                appear that 5-HT<sub>7</sub>Dro and Fru<sup>M</sup> do not directly interact in
                their modulation and control of courtship and mating behaviors.</p>
      <p>What then is the role that 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptor signaling plays in reducing
                receptivity at each stage? One possibility is that pheromone release from the female
                may be disrupted, resulting in a decrease of courtship. We believe that this is
                unlikely, however, because control males paired with SB fed females continue to
                attempt copulation with SB fed females that are not receptive, and will continually
                chase these females in the mating chamber, which remain uninterested despite
                repeated attempts by the males. Furthermore, when males fed SB were paired with
                control females, we often observed females that seemed to seek out the male, which
                would then run away from the female. Therefore, it would appear that because the
                control fly of the pair seeks out and attempts to initiate courtship behaviors, SB
                treatment and manipulation of 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptor function does not interfere
                with pheromone release, or potentially other sensory cues, related to receptivity.
                If the default behavior is to initiate courtship in the absence of pheromones,
                however, then it may still be possible that SB is interfering with pheromone
                reception at later stages if they are required for the maintenance and
                intensification of courtship. In the SB/control pairing experiments, the SB fed male
                + control female pairs were the least successful at courtship behavior. One
                interpretation of these results are that males are essential to initiating certain
                elements of mating that are regulated by 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptor function, and
                when these do not occur it may contribute to further lack of receptivity by females.
                Alternatively, males and females may be only responding to the SB drug
                differently.</p>
      <p>Because of the high level of expression of the 5-HT<sub>7</sub>Dro-GAL4 driver in the
                large-field R field neurons that innervate the ellipsoid body, we hypothesize that
                receptor expression in these neurons is relevant for normal courtship and mating.
                Furthermore, that the 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptors expressed by these neurons regulate
                receptivity/interest of one fly for its partner. Little is known regarding the exact
                function of the ellipsoid body, and the neurons that feed into it. The overall
                structure is believed to be involved in mediating higher order behaviors, including
                aspects of learning and memory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020800-Neuser1">[56]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020800-Wang1">[57]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020800-Wu1">[58]</xref>, stress response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020800-Neckameyer2">[59]</xref>, flight control <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020800-Ilius1">[60]</xref>, and gravitaxis
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020800-Baker1">[61]</xref>. It is
                comprised of many distinct cell types and individual circuits including 10 types of
                small field neurons, and 4 known major types of large-field R neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020800-Renn1">[31]</xref>. Previous reports
                have indicated that there are about 40 large-field R neurons in each of two clusters
                in the central brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020800-Renn1">[31]</xref>, and based upon the number of large-field R neurons that
                we detect 5-HT<sub>7</sub>Dro-GAL4 GFP expression in, there may be nearly 50,
                suggesting that there are additional subtypes of this neuron beyond those already
                identified. Significantly, 5-HT<sub>7</sub>Dro-GAL4 may be the first GAL4 driver
                line reported that predominantly and strongly drives expression in the putative full
                set of large-field R neurons within the central brain, and as such may be a valuable
                strain to use to define the functional role of these cells and the development of
                ellipsoid body circuits. A subset, the R4m neurons, are cholinergic and express NMDA
                receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020800-Wu1">[58]</xref>. It
                remains to be seen which of the major subsets of large-field R neurons contribute to
                courtship and mating behaviors. Although we hypothesize that it is the ellipsoid
                body mediating courtship behaviors, it is entirely possible that other neurons that
                are weakly expressing 5-HT<sub>7</sub>Dro-GAL4, or neurons perhaps not expressing
                the 5-HT<sub>7</sub>Dro-GAL4 element in the brain, are contributing to or completely
                mediating these observed effect on courtship and mating.</p>
      <p>Courtship and mating has been shown by others to involve additional neurotransmitter
                systems including dopamine, which has been shown to play a role in both female
                receptivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020800-Neckameyer1">[24]</xref> as well as male-male courtship <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020800-Liu1">[62]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020800-Liu2">[63]</xref>, and GABA, which also plays a role
                in female receptivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020800-Sakai1">[64]</xref>. Various brain structures including the mushroom bodies,
                protocerebrum, and optic lobes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020800-Villella1">[47]</xref> have also been shown to be involved in courtship and
                mating in the fly. With regards to courtship and mating, the 5-HT<sub>7</sub>Dro
                circuitry, the ellipsoid body, or both, may be essential to the integration and
                processing of information received from the various sensory stimuli to correctly
                initiate physical courtship behaviors. Significantly, proper function of
                GÎ±s-coupled 5-HT<sub>7</sub>Dro receptor signaling within these neurons may also
                be essential to this process. Interestingly, 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptors have also
                been implicated in the regulation of mammalian sexual behavior, although the
                response is reverse to that in flies. Blockade of this receptor with antagonist in
                female rats increases lordosis activity, and the authors of the study hypothesize
                that in mammals 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptors exert a tonic inhibitory effect on female
                sexual behavior <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020800-Siddiqui1">[15]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In summary, we have generated a 5-HT<sub>7</sub>Dro-GAL4 reporter and have used it to
                characterize the putative expression of the 5-HT<sub>7</sub>Dro receptor, and find
                it highly expressed in the brain in large-field R neurons in the adult, as well as
                in small groups of cells that cluster with PDF-positive LNvs neurons. Functional
                studies utilizing pharmacological and genetic methods indicate that this receptor is
                necessary for normal courtship and mating.</p>

                        appear white (in boxed area) due to superposition in this projection of
                        about 12 sections. In panel Biv we show two optical sections in the boxed
                        area to visualize that neurons do not coexpress markers. C) Also in
                        abdominal neuromeres the two labels are not coexpressed.</p>
