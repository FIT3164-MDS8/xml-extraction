<abstract>
<p>The circadian clock is closely related to human health, such as metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease. Our previous study revealed that irregular feeding induced abnormal lipid metabolism with disruption of the hepatic circadian clock. We hypothesized that breakfast skipping induces lipid abnormalities, such as adiposity, by altering the hepatic circadian oscillation of clock and lipid metabolism-related genes. Here, we established a delayed first active-phase meal (DFAM) protocol as a breakfast-skipping model. Briefly, rats were fed a high-fat diet during zeitgeber time (ZT) 12–24 in a control group and ZT 16–4 in the DFAM group. The DFAM group showed increased body weight gain and perirenal adipose tissue weight without a change in total food intake. The circadian oscillations of hepatic clock and <italic>de novo</italic> fatty acid synthesis genes were delayed by 2–4 h because of DFAM. The peaks of serum insulin, a synchronizer for the liver clock, bile acids, and non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) were delayed by 4–6 h because of DFAM. Moreover, DFAM delayed the surge in body temperature by 4 h and may have contributed to the increase in body weight gain and adipose tissue weight because of decreased energy expenditure. These data indicated a potential molecular mechanism by which breakfast skipping induces abnormal lipid metabolism, which is related to the altered circadian oscillation of hepatic gene expression. The results also suggested that the delayed peaks of serum NEFA, bile acids, and insulin entrain the circadian rhythm of hepatic clock and lipid metabolism-related genes.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In mammals, physiological and behavior rhythms such as sleep-wake cycles, the endocrine system, body temperature, and locomotor activity are driven by circadian clocks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206669.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206669.ref002">2</xref>]. Mammalian circadian clocks are organized as a hierarchical oscillator system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206669.ref003">3</xref>]. The master clock, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), is located in the hypothalamus and is responsible for orchestrating peripheral clocks in the liver and other organs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206669.ref004">4</xref>]. The circadian clock is formed by a negative feedback system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206669.ref005">5</xref>]. The circadian locomotor output cycles protein kaput (CLOCK) and brain and muscle Arnt-like protein 1 (BMAL1) heterodimer activates the transcription of period (PER) and cryptochrome (CRY) genes. The PER and CRY proteins form a heterodimer that suppresses the transactivation by CLOCK/BMAL1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206669.ref005">5</xref>]. Other clock genes such as differentiated embryo chondrocytes (DEC), nuclear receptor subfamily 1, group D, member 1 (REV-ERBα), nuclear receptor subfamily 1, group D, member 2 (REV-ERBβ), and nuclear receptor subfamily 1, group F, member 1 (RORα) also participate in the negative feedback loop. Furthermore, several clock genes regulate carbohydrate, lipid, and amino acid metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206669.ref006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206669.ref011">11</xref>].</p>
<p>In modern society, many people are exposed to irregular eating patterns such as shift work and jet lag. Recent studies have demonstrated a close relationship between eating behavior and several metabolic diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206669.ref012">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206669.ref014">14</xref>]. Many studies have reported that females who work at irregular times, such as nurses and flight attendants, have a higher risk of cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206669.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206669.ref016">16</xref>]; moreover, shift workers more frequently suffer health problems such as metabolic syndromes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206669.ref017">17</xref>], cardiovascular diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206669.ref018">18</xref>], cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206669.ref019">19</xref>], and abnormal blood lipids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206669.ref020">20</xref>]. Misalignment of diurnal oscillations of some hormones was suggested to contribute to a higher risk of diseases in shift workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206669.ref021">21</xref>]. Diurnal oscillations of insulin and glucagon are mainly controlled by feeding-fasting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206669.ref022">22</xref>]. Additionally, oscillations of glucocorticoids are controlled by the circadian clock and feeding-fasting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206669.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206669.ref024">24</xref>]. <italic>Clock</italic> mutant mice exhibited altered diurnal feeding rhythms and obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206669.ref025">25</xref>]. <italic>Bmal1</italic>-knockout mice showed abnormal lipid metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206669.ref026">26</xref>]. Our previous study showed that irregular feeding induced hypercholesterolemia by disrupting the circadian oscillations of several clock genes and shifted the peak of the circadian oscillation of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206669.ref027">27</xref>]. CYP7A1 is a rate-limiting enzyme in the reaction that converts cholesterol to bile acids, and its circadian oscillation is regulated by D site of albumin promoter binding protein (DBP), a liver-enriched transcriptional activator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206669.ref028">28</xref>]. It has also been reported that time-restricted feeding ameliorates abnormal lipid metabolism and obesity induced by feeding of a high-fat diet in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206669.ref029">29</xref>]. Time-restricted feeding of excess sucrose also ameliorated the development of fatty liver and hyperlipidemia in rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206669.ref030">30</xref>]. These studies indicate that feeding timing is important for health by changing the circadian oscillations of clock and nutrient metabolism-related genes.</p>
<p>Breakfast skipping has serious implications for human health. Breakfast is recognized as the most important meal among the commonly found 3-meals by day pattern, and many studies have reported the health benefits associated with breakfast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206669.ref031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206669.ref032">32</xref>], but not with lunch and dinner. In the USA and Europe, 10–30% of children and adolescents regularly skip breakfast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206669.ref033">33</xref>]. In Japan, 28.2% of 20–29-year-olds were found to skip breakfast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206669.ref034">34</xref>]. Many epidemiological studies have reported that breakfast skipping is associated with various health issues, such as a higher body mass index [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206669.ref035">35</xref>], and higher risks of metabolic syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206669.ref036">36</xref>], type 2 diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206669.ref037">37</xref>], and coronary heart disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206669.ref038">38</xref>]. Additionally, some studies have linked breakfast skipping with the learning performance of children and adolescents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206669.ref039">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206669.ref040">40</xref>]. However, these studies were observational and did not determine the molecular mechanism underlying how breakfast skipping induces abnormal metabolic problems in humans. Several studies have investigated the effect of meal shifting on lipid metabolism and metabolic abnormalities in rodents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206669.ref029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206669.ref030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206669.ref041">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206669.ref044">44</xref>]. Delayed meal timing for 6 h in active-phase induced heavier body weight, increased lipid synthesis, and delayed hepatic clock gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206669.ref041">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206669.ref042">42</xref>]. However, 2 h of delayed time-restricted feeding for 8 h in active phase ameliorated obesity induced by feeding a high-fat diet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206669.ref029">29</xref>]. These studies indicated that the delayed period and duration of feeding are very important in lipid metabolism and clock gene regulation. To investigate the effect of breakfast skipping in an animal model, we set the duration of the feeding and delayed periods to 12 and 4 h, respectively, to more closely reflect human breakfast skipping compared to previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206669.ref029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206669.ref041">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206669.ref042">42</xref>]. We hypothesized that breakfast skipping induces metabolic disorders through abnormal circadian oscillations. We established a breakfast-skipping rat model and investigated whether a 4-h delayed first active-phase meal (DFAM) affects lipid metabolism by altering the circadian oscillations of clock or lipid metabolism-related genes in the liver. We found that DFAM increased body weight gain and adipose tissue weight without changing the total food intake. We also found that peaks in the circadian oscillation of the hepatic clock and lipid metabolism-related genes were delayed by 2–4 h by DFAM. Thus, DFAM induced metabolic disorders by delaying the circadian oscillations of clock and lipid metabolism-related genes.</p>

<p>The animal study was approved by the Animal Care Committee of Nagoya University (approval no.2015092501) and performed in compliance with the Rules and Regulations of the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, Nagoya University. Surgical procedures were performed under isoflurane anesthesia, and efforts were made to minimize suffering. Fifty-six 5-week-old male Wistar rats were purchased from Japan SLC (Shizuoka, Japan). Rats were housed in individual wire-bottomed cages and kept under a 12-h light cycle, zeitgeber time (ZT) 0–12. During the experimental periods, the rats were allowed free access to water. Rats were first provided a stock diet (Lab MR Breeder, Nosan Co., Yokohama, Japan) for 1 day and then a basal diet for 2 days before surgery. The composition of the basal diet was (in g/kg) sucrose, 218; starch, 435; corn oil, 50; casein, 200; cellulose, 50; vitamin mixture (AIN93-VX), 10; mineral mixture (AIN93-MX), 35; and choline chloride, 2. On day 3, the eight rats in the control group and nine rats in the DFAM group were implanted with a temperature data logger (KN Laboratories Osaka, Japan) into the intraperitoneal cavity. After surgery, the rats were allowed to recover from surgery for 3 days and fed a high-fat diet. The composition of the high-fat diet was (in g/kg) sucrose, 161; starch, 322; corn oil, 20; lard, 150; casein, 250; cellulose, 50; vitamin mixture (AIN93-VX), 10; mineral mixture (AIN93-MX), 35; and choline chloride, 2. The energy sources were 43.3% carbohydrate, 22.4% protein, and 34.3% lipid. The amount of lipid in the high-fat diet was determined based on the median lipid energy intake of the human population in the USA reported in 2005 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206669.ref045">45</xref>]. Six days after the rats arrived, they were divided into control (n = 28) and DFAM groups (n = 28). Control rats were allowed access to a diet from ZT 12–24. The DFAM group was allowed access to a diet from ZT 16–4. We set the experiment to a fixed-duration of feeding time at 12 h, as previous studies showed that this duration affects lipid metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206669.ref029">29</xref>]. Although this DFAM protocol shifted the feeding time to a 4-h delay, we use this as a model of breakfast skipping. The daily food amount was calculated based on the amount of food intake on the previous day. The total amount of food was approximately 1.1-fold of that on the previous day. Therefore, the rats were provided enough food each day. Rats are nocturnal animals and eat approximately 80% of their total food intake during the dark period (ZT 12–24) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206669.ref046">46</xref>]. The control group was fed one-third of the total daily food amount during ZT 12–16 and fed two-thirds during ZT 16–24. The DFAM group was fed two-thirds of a total daily food amount during ZT 16–24 and fed one-third during ZT 24–4. After their food was removed at ZT 0 for the control group and ZT 4 for the DFAM group, weighted, and total daily food intake was then calculated. We next calculated the amount of the next meal. The experimental period was 14–15 days. Four rats from each group were sacrificed at the 4-h intervals from day 14 ZT 2 to day 15 ZT 2. Their livers and epididymal adipose tissues were harvested and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Subsequently, the tissues were stored at -80°C until use analysis.</p>

Both groups consumed approximately 30% of the daily food every 4 h during the 12-h feeding period, as expected. Because both groups consumed similar amounts of the diet for 12 h, we predicted that the DFAM protocol could be applicable as a model for breakfast skipping.</p>

<title>DFAM delayed the surge in body temperature</title>
<p>The master regulator of circadian oscillation is the SCN. Additionally, the regulator of body temperature is located in the anterior hypothalamus, where circadian oscillation is regulated by the SCN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206669.ref050">50</xref>]. In the control group, body temperature was elevated at the onset of the active phase (ZT 12) and decreased at the onset of the rest period (ZT 24). However, in the DFAM group, body temperature moderately increased at ZT 12, sharply increased at the time of eating (ZT 16), and then decreased at ZT 1, even if the rats were still consuming the diet until ZT 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206669.g001">Fig 1E</xref>). Locomotor activity is also an important factor to regulate the body temperature. We did not measure the locomotor activity and pattern in the present study. However, in another DFAM experiment using a similar experimental procedure, we found that the total and pattern of locomotor activity was similar in both the control and DFAM groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0206669.s010">S1 Fig</xref>). These data indicate that the surge in body temperature was regulated by both light and feeding, but the decrease in body temperature was regulated mainly by light.</p>

Oscillations in PER1 and PER2 gene expression were delayed by DFAM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0206669.s011">S2 Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0206669.s008">S8 Table</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0206669.s009">S9 Table</xref>).</p>

<p>Breakfast skipping increases the risk of obesity, higher body mass index, metabolic syndrome, and type II diabetes in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206669.ref035">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206669.ref038">38</xref>]. However, it is difficult to identify the molecular mechanism underlying how breakfast skipping induces metabolic disorders. In the present study, we hypothesized that breakfast skipping induces abnormalities in lipid metabolism by altering the hepatic circadian clock. To investigate the underlying molecular mechanism of the effect of breakfast skipping on metabolism, we developed a DFAM protocol. The rats showed significantly increased body weight gain and perirenal adipose tissue weight and exhibited a tendency for increased total adipose tissue weight upon undergoing DFAM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206669.g001">Fig 1B and 1D</xref>).</p>
<p>Circadian oscillations in the peripheral tissues, such as in the liver, are controlled by the SCN and feeding behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206669.ref058">58</xref>]. In our previous study, we found that insulin synchronized the circadian clocks in the liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206669.ref059">59</xref>]. In the present study, peaks of hepatic clock genes were delayed by 2–4 h because of DFAM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206669.g003">Fig 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0206669.s004">S4 Table</xref>). The delayed hepatic circadian clock oscillations may be mediated through the 4-h delay in the circadian oscillation of insulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206669.g002">Fig 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0206669.s003">S3 Table</xref>). Additionally, the circadian oscillations of serum NEFA and bile acids were also delayed by 4–6 h because of DFAM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206669.g002">Fig 2D and 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0206669.s003">S3 Table</xref>). Although serum bile acid oscillation was delayed by DFAM, oscillation of the CYP7A1 gene was not affected. Enterohepatic circulation of bile acids may mainly control circadian oscillation. These data suggest that serum NEFA and bile acids function as synchronizers of the hepatic circadian clock. It has been reported that the amplitude of circadian oscillation was enhanced by adding bile acids to Caco2 cells; further the expression of hepatic circadian clock genes was significantly changed upon oral administration of bile acids in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206669.ref060">60</xref>]. NEFA may enhance the entraining activity of insulin by accelerating insulin secretion from β cells by NEFA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206669.ref061">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206669.ref062">62</xref>]; however, no studies have directly examined whether NEFA affects the circadian clock. NEFA and bile acids may function together to synchronize the circadian clock.</p>
<p>Numerous studies have indicated that disruption of the circadian oscillation of clock genes induces abnormal lipid metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206669.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206669.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206669.ref025">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206669.ref028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206669.ref051">51</xref>]. <italic>CLOCK</italic> mutant mice exhibited abnormal diurnal feeding rhythm and obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206669.ref025">25</xref>]. <italic>BMAL1</italic>-knockout mice showed suppressed adipogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206669.ref026">26</xref>]. Moreover, <italic>REV-ERBα</italic>-knockout mice showed abnormal blood lipid levels by altering hepatic circadian rhythms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206669.ref051">51</xref>]. In our previous study, suppressing the feeding rhythm induced hypercholesterolemia by advancing the phase of CYP7A1 by altering the circadian oscillation of DBP in rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206669.ref027">27</xref>]. Because metabolic pathways are generally controlled systematically, once the active phases of regulatory enzymes are delayed or advanced by several hours, orchestrated metabolic regulation can be disrupted. In the present study, the peaks of lipogenesis-related genes were delayed by 2–4 h and those of cholesterol metabolism-related genes were delayed by 4–6 h because of DFAM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206669.g004">Fig 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0206669.s005">S5 Table</xref>). These results suggest that changes in the circadian oscillation of clock and lipogenesis genes caused by DFAM contribute to abnormal lipid metabolism. Metabolic pathways, such as lipogenesis, glycolysis, and the pentose phosphate pathway, are interconnected. The circadian oscillation of glucose metabolism-related genes, such as GCK, was also delayed by 2–4 h because of breakfast skipping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206669.g005">Fig 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0206669.s006">S6 Table</xref>). These results suggest that misalignment of the circadian oscillation of glycolysis contributes to abnormal lipid metabolism caused by DFAM.</p>
<p>The circadian oscillation of body temperature is controlled by a regulator in the anterior hypothalamus that shows circadian oscillations under control of the SCN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206669.ref050">50</xref>]. Body temperature in control rats was elevated at ZT 12 and decreased at ZT 24 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206669.g001">Fig 1E</xref>). In the DFAM group, body temperature moderately increased at ZT 12 and sharply increased at ZT 16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206669.g001">Fig 1E</xref>) when the rats began eating. This indicates that the surge in body temperature was regulated not only by light, but also by feeding. However, the decrease in body temperature of the rats in the DFAM group was only delayed by 1 h compared to that in the control group, even if the rats were still consuming the diet during ZT 0–4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206669.g001">Fig 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206669.g001">Fig 1E</xref>). Locomotor activity is an important factor regulating the body temperature. Although we did not measure the locomotor activity and pattern in the present study, we found that the total and pattern of locomotor activity were similar in both the control and DFAM groups in another DFAM experiment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0206669.s010">S1 Fig</xref>). Thus, we predicted that the surge in body temperature was regulated by both feeding and light, whereas the decrease in body temperature was mainly regulated by light. We estimated and compared the area of body temperature difference between both groups during ZT 12–16 and ZT 0–4. The area of ZT 12–16 was approximately 1.7-fold greater than that of ZT 0–4. These results suggest that reduced energy expenditure because of the 4-h delay in the body temperature surge led to increased body weight gain and accumulation of lipids in adipose tissues upon DFAM.</p>
<p>The present study revealed that DFAM increased body weight gain because of fat accumulation in the adipose tissues. Even with only a 4-h delay at the onset of the first active-phase meal, breakfast, the circadian oscillation of clock and lipid metabolism-related genes were delayed by 2–4 h. These results suggest that the delayed circadian rhythm of clock genes and lipid metabolism leads to increased body and adipose tissue weights. This study proposes that metabolic abnormality and obesity caused by breakfast skipping in humans would be mediated through alterations in the circadian rhythms of the peripheral tissues, such as the liver.</p>
