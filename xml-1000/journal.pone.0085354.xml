<abstract>
<p>Infections caused by enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) can lead to diarrhea with abdominal cramps and sometimes are complicated by severe hemolytic uremic syndrome. EHEC secretes effector proteins into host cells through a type III secretion system that is composed of proteins encoded by a chromosomal island, locus for the enterocyte effacement (LEE). EspA is the major component of the filamentous structure connecting the bacteria and the host's cells. Synthesis and secretion of EspA must be carefully controlled since the protein is prone to polymerize. CesAB, CesA2, and EscL have been identified as being able to interact with EspA. Furthermore, the intracellular level of EspA declines when cesAB, cesA2, and escL are individually deleted. Here, we report a LEE gene named l0033, which also affects the intracellular level of EspA. We renamed l0033 as escA since its counterpart in enteropathogenic E. coli has been recently described. Similar to CesAB, EscL, and CesA2, EscA interacts with EspA and enhances the protein stability of EspA. However, EscA is also able to interact with inner membrane-associated EscL, CesA2, and EscN, but not with cytoplasmic CesAB. In terms of gene organizations, escA locates in LEE3. Expression of EscA is faithfully regulated via Mpc, the first gene product of LEE3. Since Mpc is tightly regulated to low level, we suggest that EscA is highly synchronized and critical to the process of escorting EspA to its final destination.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Enterohemorrhagic <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (EHEC) O157:H7 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085354-Banatvala1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085354-Kaper1">[2]</xref> forms typical histological lesions termed attaching and effacing lesions on the large intestine tissue of infected individuals. This lesion-generating capability is attributed largely to a set of virulence genes clustering on the bacterial chromosome that is called the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085354-Elliott1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085354-Hayashi1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085354-Perna1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085354-Spears1">[6]</xref>. The LEE contains 41 open reading frames (Orfs) that are largely organized into five poly-cistronic operons. These Orfs have been studied in detail to a variety of different degrees <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085354-Neves1">[7]</xref> and the better characterized gene products have been categorized into a number of groups, namely components of a type III secretion system (TTSS) (Sep and Esc), secreted translocators and effector proteins (Esp), chaperones (Ces), regulatory factors (Ler, GrlA, GrlR, and Mpc), an adhesin (Eae) and a translocated receptor (Tir). Gene <italic>l0033</italic> in EHEC is among the least well characterized genes and the equivalent genes in <italic>Citrobacter rodentium</italic> and enteropathogenic <italic>E. coli</italic> (EPEC) have been shown to play critical roles in the TTSS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085354-Deng1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085354-SalMan1">[9]</xref>. However, information on the mechanism of action of this gene still remains limited.</p>
<p>TTSSs exist in several Gram-negative bacteria that are either pathogenic or symbiotic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085354-Buttner1">[10]</xref>. The main function of any TTSS is to efficiently and specifically deliver effector proteins from the bacterial cytoplasm into the eukaryote target cell cytoplasm by a direct contact through a syringe-like conduit. In the case of EHEC, one phenotype after delivery of the effector proteins is an induction of rearrangement of the cellular actin by altering the signaling pathways of the infected cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085354-Gruenheid1">[11]</xref>. These alterations result in the formation of pedestal structures. The syringe-like conduit formed is evolutionarily similar to that associated with flagella systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085354-Aizawa1">[12]</xref>. Ultra-structurally, the whole structure is organized into a needle complex and a basal body. The needle complex of EHEC consists of EspA in the filamentous portion with the tip being EspA in complex with EspB and EspD. On the other hand, the basal body structure consists of an inner membrane ring and an outer membrane ring <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085354-Cornelis1">[13]</xref>. In addition to the structural consideration described above, in order to assemble a mature and effective secretion apparatus, timing is highly critical. It is believed that the needle complex is secreted by the TTSS and is then assembled onto the basal body to produce the distal elements of the apparatus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085354-Deane1">[14]</xref>.</p>
<p>To better understand the mechanistic activity of the TTSS in EHEC, it is highly important to characterize the functions of the less well understood genes in these operons because no gene within the LEE island is dispensable if the TTSS is to be functional and effective <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085354-Deng1">[8]</xref>. <italic>Orf l0033</italic> of EHEC consists of 378 base-pairs and this encodes a protein of 125 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 14.66 kDa. By protein sequence comparison, L0033 shares 100% identity with a counterpart in EPEC and 95% identity with that of a counterpart in <italic>C. rodentium</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085354-SalMan1">[9]</xref>. Furthermore, there are no other homologues found outside the LEE family. Recent studies in EPEC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085354-SalMan1">[9]</xref> have confirmed previous findings for <italic>C. rodentium</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085354-Deng1">[8]</xref> whereby the counterparts of <italic>l0033</italic> are essential for the secretion of both translocator and effector. Since the gene in these two strains has been renamed <italic>escA</italic>, we will from now on refer to <italic>l0033</italic> as <italic>escA</italic> to allow easier discussion. Moreover, no functional and evolutionary origin for EscA has been suggested based on previous bioinformatics analysis of the LEE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085354-Pallen1">[15]</xref>. Using yeast two-hybrid system analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085354-Creasey1">[16]</xref>, no LEE protein has been found to interact with EscA. However, in contrast to the yeast two-hybrid results, in a recent bacterial pull-down assay EscA had been found to interact with EscC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085354-SalMan1">[9]</xref>. We have therefore reasoned that there must be additional function(s) carried out by EscA. In this study, our findings suggest that EscA is able to affect the stability of the EspA. In addition to this, EscA was found to interact independently with two EspA-binding proteins (CesA2 and EscL) and EscN, but not a third EspA-binding protein (CesAB). Finally, when regulation in EHEC is examined, it is interesting to note that the expression of EscA has been linked to the presence of Mpc, a protein that is absolutely needed for TTTS functionality; however, this protein is tightly regulated and maintained a low level.</p>

<title>Decreased stability of EspA in the absence of <italic>escA</italic></title>
<p>To examine the possibility that the decreased level of intracellular EspA is controlled transcriptionally at the promoter, we introduced <italic>T5</italic> promoter-driven expression of EspA-His<sub>√ó6</sub> into the Œî<italic>escA</italic> mutant and the parental strain (WT) separately. In these systems, the transcription of the tagged EspA was straightforwardly governed by the <italic>T5 cis</italic>-element of the plasmid. As a control in parallel, EspB-His<sub>√ó6</sub> was similarly introduced. After 6 h-cultivation of the bacteria in M9 medium, the expression levels of EspA-His<sub>√ó6</sub> and EspB-His<sub>√ó6</sub> were determined by Western blotting. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0085354-g002">Figure 2A</xref> shows that the expression levels of EspB-His<sub>√ó6</sub> were similar in both the WT and Œî<italic>escA</italic> strains.

These results strongly suggest that the intracellular level of EspA is down-regulated in a novel manner in the Œî<italic>escA</italic> mutant and that transcriptional regulation is unable to account for the differences in expression levels. To confirm that the expression of EspA in strain Œî<italic>escA</italic> is not regulated at the mRNA level, a transcriptional fusion reporter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085354-Ku1">[23]</xref> was used.

<p>To account for the decreased intracellular EspA level in the Œî<italic>escA</italic> strain, we next hypothesized that, in the absence of EscA, EspA might be unstable. To validate this notion, the stability of EspA in the parental WT and that in the Œî<italic>escA</italic> strain were compared after <italic>de novo</italic> protein synthesis in the bacteria was suppressed by treatment with chloramphenicol. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0085354-g002">Figure 2B</xref> shows the Western blotting results for EspA in the bacterial lysates that were harvested at various time points. Apparently, EspA is rather unstable in the Œî<italic>escA</italic> mutant when compared to the parental WT strain. The protein level of EspA in the Œî<italic>escA</italic> mutant was lower than that in the parental strain at time zero and the protein had decayed greatly after 1 h, as revealed by quantitative measurement of the relative protein abundance using densitometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0085354-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). In contrast, EspA in the WT strain was maintained at a relatively high level during the sampling period over 16 h.</p>
<p>Whether the unstable EspA in the Œî<italic>escA</italic> mutant could result from a decrease of CesA2 and EscL, proteins known to interact with EspA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085354-Ku1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085354-Su1">[26]</xref> and EscA (see below), was further examined. By an approach similar to that used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0085354-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>, we examined CesA2 and EscL that were encoded by pQE-CesA2 and pQE-EscL, respectively, and expressed in the plasmid-transformed Œî<italic>escA</italic> mutant. The results were then side-by-side compared with that seen in the parental WT strain. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0085354-g002">Figure 2D</xref> shows that CesA2 (left panel) and EscL (right panel) were detected indistinguishably in both strains, a result suggesting that CesA2 and EscL are as stable as in the WT strain when the bacteria lack EscA.</p>

<title>Interaction of EscA with EspA</title>
<p>To address whether the instability of EspA in the Œî<italic>escA</italic> mutant is due to a lack of protein interaction contributed by EscA, we generated p<italic>T5</italic>-EspA_His-EscA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0085354-g003">Figure 3A</xref>) to express tag-free EspA and His<sub>√ó6</sub>-tagged EscA simultaneously. We examined whether the two proteins could be co-purified because of a possible interaction. After washing and affinity purification of His<sub>√ó6</sub>-tagged EscA from the Ni<sup>2+</sup>-NTA column, EspA was readily detected in the fractions where EscA was eluted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0085354-g003">Figure 3B</xref>).

<title>Interactions of EscA with CesA2, EscL, and EscN</title>
<p>The above results indicate that, in the absence of EscA, the stability of EspA was decreased in EHEC and that EscA possessed the abilities to interact with EspA biochemically. These two properties of EscA are similar to those of three other proteins, namely the two chaperons reported for EspA, CesAB and CesA2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085354-Su1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085354-Creasey2">[27]</xref> and the EspA-binding protein EscL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085354-Ku1">[23]</xref>. Thus, we proposed that EscA might conjoin with these proteins in assisting the movement of EspA and perhaps a close interaction between these proteins might exist. To test this notion, pull-down assays were performed to examine a possible interaction between EscA and any one of these three previously known EspA-binding proteins. First, tag-free EscA and His<sub>√ó6</sub>-tagged CesA2-expressing JM109 were separately cultured and total proteins were subsequently harvested. After binding His<sub>√ó6</sub>-tagged CesA2 onto Ni<sup>2+</sup>-NTA column and followed by washing, tag-free EscA was subsequently applied to the column. After additional washing and elution, EscA was found to appear with His<sub>√ó6</sub>-tagged CesA2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0085354-g004">Figure 4A</xref>) in the eluent fractions. A similar experiment was carried out to investigate the interaction between EscA and EscL, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0085354-g004">Figure 4B</xref> shows a positive result that is similar to that of EscA and CesA2. An irrelevant His<sub>√ó6</sub>-tagged protein (YgfZ) was used as negative control to test for co-elution with EscA using the Ni<sup>2+</sup>-NTA column. Using this control protein, no EscA was detected in the eluent fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0085354-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). On the other hand, a similar attempt to pinpoint whether there is an interaction between EscA and CesAB using the same strategy gave a clearly negative result, which is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0085354-g004">Figure 4D</xref>.</p>

<p>It has been previously reported that CesAB could not interact with EscN. However, the interaction occurs after CesAB interacts with EspA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085354-Chen1">[28]</xref>. Therefore, whether EscA could form complex with EscN prior to the interaction of EscA with EspA is then addressed. First, amino acid sequences of CesAB and that of EscA were compared and no primary sequence similarity could be concluded. Second, an interaction possibility between EscA and EscN was tested by using affinity Ni<sup>2+</sup>-NTA column to retain His<sub>√ó6</sub>-tagged EscN and followed by applying untagged EscA; whether EscA could be co-eluted with EscN was then examined. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0085354-g004">Figure 4E</xref> shows positively that EscA alone could interact with EscN as evidenced by the results of co-elution.</p>
<p>To unveil the second layer of possibility, we address whether stable interaction between EspA with CesA2 could be disrupted by the presence of EscA or a ternary complex could be formed after the addition of EscA. His<sub>√ó6</sub>-tagged CesA2 and tag-free EspA interaction was first performed in the Ni<sup>2+</sup>-NTA column. It was then followed by applying tag-free EscA in a clarified bacterial lysate into the column. After extensive washing, proteins co-retained with His<sub>√ó6</sub>-tagged CesA2 in the Ni<sup>2+</sup>-NTA column was examined by Western blotting analysis. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0085354-g005">Figure 5A</xref> shows clearly that EspA and CesA2 were detected in the eluent fraction but not EscA, a result suggesting that the complex of CesA2 and EspA remains stable and neither a ternary complex consisting of CesA2-EspA-EscA is stably formed after the addition of EscA. A similar experiment was performed by retaining His<sub>√ó6</sub>-tagged EscL and tag-free EspA first in the column followed by supplementing with EscA. Neither disturbing effect nor ternary multipart formation was seen with the addition of EscA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0085354-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). A negative observation was also found when EscA was added into the column that first retained His<sub>√ó6</sub>-tagged CesAB and EspA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0085354-g005">Figure 5C</xref>).</p>

<title>Regulation of EscA expression</title>
<p>To explore the possibility that there is an EscA regulatory mechanism in EHEC, we tested whether the expression of EscA was responding to the known gene deletions in LEE that grossly affect TTS of EHEC.

Since expression of EscA from pQE-EscA is governed by the exogenous promoter <italic>T5</italic>, it was reasoned that the above expression differences were unlikely to be due to transcriptional variation at the <italic>escA</italic> mRNA level between strain AC36 (or Œî<italic>ler</italic>) and strain Œî<italic>grlA</italic> or Œî<italic>grlR</italic>.

<title>Expressing regulation of EscA is mediated by interaction with Mpc</title>
<p>To test the above possibilities, we examined the strains AC36 and Œî<italic>ler</italic> after supplementing with the critical element to determine whether correct EscA expression was recovered. Since Ler is a global LEE regulator that activates multiple <italic>lee</italic> operons when up-regulation is signaled, it would not be surprising that extra Ler was able to trigger an increase in expression of various LEE proteins including EscA. Therefore, we chose rather to ectopically express Mpc from a compatible plasmid pAC-Mpc. Mpc and EscA, both His<sub>√ó6</sub> tagged, were co-expressed in strains AC36 and Œî<italic>ler</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0085354-g007">Figure 7A</xref>).

As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0085354-g007">Figure 7A</xref>, strain Œî<italic>escA</italic> that simultaneously harbored pQE-EscA and pAC-Mpc gave an increasing expression of EscA when compared to the same strain harboring pQE-EscA alone (compare lanes 1 and 2). Using strain AC36 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0085354-g007">Figure 7A</xref>, lane 3) and as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0085354-g006">Figure 6</xref>, no EscA was detected when this strain was transformed with pQE-EscA alone. However, when pAC-Mpc striking results were seen, however, when the Œî<italic>ler</italic> strain was transformed with pQE-EscA; this gave no detectable EscA as seen above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0085354-g006">Figure 6</xref>).

<p>To examine whether the amounts of mRNA coding for EscA differs between strain AC36 and the WT strain, RNAs from both strains were extracted and analyzed by qRT-PCR. Results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0085354-g007">Figure 7B</xref> indicated that the levels of <italic>escA</italic> mRNA had no significant difference between the WT and AC36 strains. The notion that RNA level difference could not account for the adverse dissimilarity between the expression levels of the two strains could be further supported by the experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0085354-g007">Figure 7A</xref>, in which mRNA for EscA was driven all by the <italic>T5</italic> promoter. Therefore, regulations that may affect the protein <italic>per se</italic> were further examined. A careful examination of EscA detected in the pQE-EscA-transformed WT and AC36 strains was then carried out. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0085354-g007">Figure 7C</xref> shows the sequential detection results of EscA after that bacteria received chloramphenicol and previously induced with IPTG for 0.5 h. EscA level in the Mpc-deficient strain (AC36) was obviously lower than that in the WT strain at time zero, and the EscA signal disappeared quickly and was barely detected after 1-h bacterial culture. On the other hand, EscA protein in WT was relative stable and it remained abundant during the assay period (8 h). The above results suggest that the protein stability of EscA may account for the major difficulty to express EscA in the absence of Mpc. A simple hypothesis is that Mpc might interact with EscA and enhance EscA expression.</p>
<p>To test the above notion, we examined the possible interaction between EscA and Mpc using a bacterial two hybrid system. In this system, interaction between target protein and bait protein is revealed by way of an increase in reporter Œ≤-galactosidase activity. As references, three negative controls and one positive control <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085354-Tsai1">[18]</xref> were included in the experiments. The results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0085354-g008">Figure 8A</xref> showed that EscA does interact with Mpc, albeit not strongly. A reciprocal hybrid, where Mpc was incorporated as the target protein with EscA acting as the bait protein, also gave a positive result (data not shown).</p>

<p>To confirm the above notion that Mpc interacts with EscA, a co-elution assay was also performed. Using a strategy similar to that seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0085354-g003">Figure 3</xref>, we generated expression plasmids expressing tag-free EscA alone and with His<sub>√ó6</sub>-tagged Mpc simultaneously. After eluting His<sub>√ó6</sub>-tagged Mpc from the Ni<sup>2+</sup>-NTA column, the fractions were examined for the presence of EscA. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0085354-g008">Figure 8B</xref> confirms that EscA is readily co-eluted with Mpc but the protein was absent from the eluent when no His<sub>√ó6</sub>-tagged Mpc was present in the system.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>EscA is a small protein rich in coiled-coil structures. Previous studies have shown that EscA is indispensable for the secretion of both translocator and effector in EPEC and <italic>C. rodentium</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085354-Deng1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085354-SalMan1">[9]</xref>. It has also been shown that EscA interacts with EscC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085354-SalMan1">[9]</xref>, one of the TTSS components on the outer membrane that protrudes toward the periplasmic space. And EscA has been found mainly in the periplasmic fraction, followed by inner membrane-associated fraction and then in the cytoplasm. The property whereby EscA is found in is consistent with the notion that EscA makes a ‚Äúcontribution to the structural integrity of the TTS complex‚Äù <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085354-SalMan1">[9]</xref> and backs the physical necessity that EscA interacts with periplasm-protruding EscC. As seen from our findings, EscA also interacts with a number of other LEE proteins in addition to EscC. First, EscA is able to interact independently with EscL and CesA2, two of the three currently known EspA-binding LEE proteins. It is worth noting that, EscL and CesA2 have been localized to the inner membrane-associated fraction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085354-Ku1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085354-Su1">[26]</xref>, a place where EscA is also detected. In contrast, CesAB is found in the bacterial cytoplasm and functions as an EspA chaperone in that compartment. However, this EspA-binding protein EscA is unable to interact with CesAB. The fact that EscA by itself is able to interact with EspA means that EscA is the fourth EspA-binding protein. Furthermore, it shares in common with the other EspA-binding proteins the fact that deletion of the gene coding for the cognate EspA-binding protein decreases the stability of EspA and this reduces the intracellular level of EspA. Therefore, EscA readily fits into this category.</p>
<p>Before being exported out, one rationale is that secretory effector proteins should be quenched with chaperons to keep them in the unfolded status. Once the TTSS is activated, these proteins should be escorted by chaperons from the cytosol to cytoplasmic base of an injectisome, a membrane-associated basal apparatus. EscN, an essential ATPase for TTSS locating to the entrance of the injectisome, provides the energy to disassemble the chaperon/effector protein complex in an ATP-dependent manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085354-Akeda1">[29]</xref>. Exemplified is that homodimeric CesAB does not interact with EscN. However, upon interaction with EspA, CesAB homodimer transforms into CesAB/EspA heterodimer that also induces a conformational switch of CesAB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085354-Chen1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085354-Chen2">[30]</xref> so that CesAB is able to interact with EscN by exposing the EscN-recognition domain. Here, we found that EscA alone is able to interact with EscN, an observation that is rather similar to the interaction between CesT and EscN <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085354-Gauthier2">[31]</xref>. To sum it up, currently known interactions among EspA and its binding proteins are depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0085354-g009">Figure 9</xref>.</p>

<title>A summary of networked interactions of currently known EspA-binding proteins.</title>
<p>Three of the four known EspA-binding proteins are associated with the inner membrane, as shown near a basal body of model TTSS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085354-Pallen1">[15]</xref>; they are EscL, CesA2, and EscA. EscA alone is able to interact with EscN ATPase, an event that characteristically differs from the interaction between CesAB and EscN, which requires a pre-exposure of CesAB to EspA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085354-Chen1">[28]</xref>. EscA also interacts with EscC that is localized to the bacterial outer membrane, perhaps due to that EscA is also present in the periplasm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085354-SalMan1">[9]</xref>. Solid line indicates an interaction previously suggested, with reference provided; interaction suggested here is asterisked. Broken arrow depicts that a conformational switch of CesAB is needed before CesAB interacts with EscN and the switch is triggered by EspA (linked by an arrow line). Note: EscA does not disrupt the binary interactions of EspA with the other EspA-binding proteins nor it stimulates a ternary complex formation from the existing binary interaction complexes.</p>

<p>Amazingly seen is that EscA is able to interact with Mpc, a protein encoded by the first gene of the <italic>LEE3</italic> operon, in which <italic>escA</italic> is the fourth open reading frame (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0085354-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Mpc has been previously shown to be indispensable but is expressed at only a low level since strong expression results in a severe suppression of the TTSS via counteraction with Ler <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085354-Tsai1">[18]</xref>. Here, we have demonstrated that Mpc is essential for the expression of EscA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0085354-g007">Figure 7</xref>). In terms of <italic>LEE3</italic> organization, <italic>escA</italic> comes after <italic>mpc</italic>, <italic>escV</italic>, and <italic>escN</italic> in the operon and before <italic>l0032</italic>, <italic>sepQ</italic>, and <italic>espH</italic>. The indispensable role of <italic>mpc</italic> in EscA expression and the interaction of Mpc with EscA suggest to us that EscA also needs to be expressed at a low level and EscA degrades rapidly without the presence of Mpc. It is then conceivable that such expression needs to occur in a timely manner for the purpose of successfully assembling the basal body of the TTSS. To test whether EscA is able to suppress the synthesis of TTSS proteins in a similar manner to Mpc, EscA was over-expressed in the WT strain of EHEC. The results (data not shown) indicate that an increased expression of EscA seems to have no apparent effect on the TTSS. Thus, it is likely that EscA does not play as profound a regulatory role in the LEE as Mpc.</p>
