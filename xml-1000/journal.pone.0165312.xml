<abstract>
<p><italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> infections of wounds in clinical settings are major complications whose outcomes are influenced by host responses that are not completely understood. Herein we evaluated transcriptomic changes of wounds as they counter <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic> infectionâ€”first active infection, and then chronic biofilm infection. We used the dermal full-thickness, rabbit ear excisional wound model. We studied the wound response: towards acute infection at 2, 6, and 24 hrs after inoculating 10<sup>6</sup> bacteria into day-3 wounds; and, towards more chronic biofilm infection of wounds similarly infected for 24 hrs but then treated with topical antibiotic to coerce biofilm growth and evaluated at day 5 and 9 post-infection. The wounds were analyzed for bacterial counts, expression of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic> virulence and biofilm-synthesis genes, biofilm morphology, infiltrating immune cells, re-epithelialization, and genome-wide gene expression (RNA-Seq transcriptome). This analysis revealed that 2 hrs after bacterial inoculation into day-3 wounds, the down-regulated genes (infected vs. non-infected) of the wound edge were nearly all non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), comprised of snoRNA, miRNA, and RNU6 pseudogenes, and their down-regulation preceded a general down-regulation of skin-enriched coding gene expression. As the active infection intensified, ncRNAs remained overrepresented among down-regulated genes; however, at 6 and 24 hrs they changed to a different set, which overlapped between these times, and excluded RNU6 pseudogenes but included snRNA components of the major and minor spliceosomes. Additionally, the raw counts of multiple types of differentially-expressed ncRNAs increased on post-wounding day 3 in control wounds, but infection suppressed this increase. After 5 and 9 days, these ncRNA counts in control wounds decreased, whereas they increased in the infected, healing-impaired wounds. These data suggest a sequential and coordinated change in the levels of transcripts of multiple major classes of ncRNAs in wound cells transitioning from inflammation to the proliferation phase of healing.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> is an opportunistic and major nosocomial pathogen that infects wounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165312.ref001">1</xref>], including chronic non-healing and combat wounds. These infections can delay wound closure, cause hypertrophic scarring, and become life-threatening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165312.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165312.ref003">3</xref>]. Currently, the interaction between bacterial pathogens and the skin wounds they infect is incompletely understood<bold>.</bold></p>
<p>As <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic> adapts to thrive in the wound, immune cells infiltrate the wound, and resident cutaneous cells in the crossfire try to adapt to the resulting stress, and are either killed or survive to participate in healing. We hypothesized that the transcriptome of the combined cells of the wound tissue countering <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic> infectionâ€”first active infection and then late-stage biofilm-predominant infectionâ€”can provide insight into mechanisms occurring during these phases of infection.</p>
<p>To evaluate this hypothesis, we used a dermal full-thickness, rabbit ear excisional wound model for its easily quantifiable healing end points and its clinical relevance as recognized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165312.ref004">4</xref>]. Using this model, we and others previously demonstrated that bacterial infections that transitioned from active planktonic to biofilm growth caused delays in granulation tissue in-growth and re-epithelialization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165312.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165312.ref005">5</xref>]. Furthermore, we previously compared wounds infected with <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic> with wounds infected with <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>, a less virulent bacterium, for transcriptomic responses of the wound and wound-proximal skin using microarrays. Compared to <italic>Klebsiella</italic>-infected wounds, <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>-infected wounds showed gene expression signatures of more intense inflammation, with the cutaneous cells exhibiting signatures of a more severe integrated stress response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165312.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165312.ref006">6</xref>].</p>
<p>Herein we used RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) to generate transcriptomes because it sensitively and accurately quantifies transcripts, can delineate transcript boundaries and identify novel species of small or non-coding RNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165312.ref007">7</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165312.ref009">9</xref>]. The wounds whose RNA-Seq transcriptomes were analyzed were also characterized regarding bacterial counts, biofilm morphology, and wound infiltration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs), monocytes and macrophages. We found suppressed expression of ncRNAs as the earliest response of the resident cutaneous cells to active infection which preceded a general down-regulation of skin-enriched gene expression. Subsequently, when the chronic biofilm-infected wounds were half closed while non-infected control wounds were almost fully closed, the biofilm-infected wounds showed higher expression of ncRNAs.</p>

At each harvest time, wounds were analyzed for numbers of bacteria (viable counts and qPCR), biofilm morphology by SEM, re-epithelialization, numbers of infiltrating neutrophils and macrophages, and global gene expression (RNA-Seq transcriptome of wound tissue).

<p>At 2 hrs post-infection, ~10-fold fewer viable counts were recovered than were seeded into the wounds. Between 2 and 6 hrs post-infection, viable and qPCR counts increased ~10-fold and then rose another ~10-fold from 6 to 24 hrs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165312.g002">Fig 2</xref>). After topical Ciloxan treatment at 24 hrs post-infection, ~100-fold fewer <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic> viable counts were subsequently recovered from the wound on post-infection day 5. Although Ciloxan treatment reduced viable counts, qPCR quantification of genome copy counts were not reduced following Ciloxan treatment, suggesting that the DNA of dead bacteria was incorporated into the wound biofilm, as has been shown previously for <italic>in vitro</italic> biofilms of other species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165312.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165312.ref010">10</xref>].

<p>To further characterize the adaptation of the bacteria to the wound and confirm the biofilm phenotype, we quantified the expression of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic> genes (quantitative reverse transcription PCR, RT-qPCR) known to function in virulence and biofilm synthesis. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165312.g004">Fig 4</xref>). Two virulence genesâ€”<italic>pscF</italic>, which encodes the type III secretion system needle protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165312.ref011">11</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165312.ref013">13</xref>] and <italic>pvdS</italic>, the iron starvation sigma factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165312.ref014">14</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165312.ref016">16</xref>]â€”both reached their highest expression level at 2 hrs post-infection: ~8- and ~13-fold, respectively, above the level in planktonic cells. By 6 and 24 hrs post-infection, the expression of both of these virulence genes dropped down to ~3-fold above the planktonic cell level.</p>
<p>In contrast, the two genes involved in biofilm synthesisâ€”<italic>alg8</italic>, a glycosyltransferase in the synthesis of the exopolysaccharide alginate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165312.ref017">17</xref>], and <italic>algE</italic>, the outer membrane porin through which alginate exits the cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165312.ref018">18</xref>]â€”were most highly expressed on post-infection day 5, being ~14- and ~5-fold elevated, respectively, over their levels at the 24 hr time point. But by day 9 their expression had dropped down to ~5- and &lt; ~2-fold, respectively, of their 24-hr levels. Thus, these data suggest that biofilm was being more actively synthesized on post-infection day 5 and was more mature on day 9.</p>

<title>Overall differential gene expression between active- and biofilm-infected wounds</title>
<p>Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed on the raw RNA-Seq read count data to evaluate its consistency. The PCA plot shows that the biological replicates are aggregated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165312.g005">Fig 5A</xref>, same colored symbols). Additionally, wounds harvested at earlier times (2, 6, and 24 hrs) segregate from wounds harvested at later times (5 and 9 days) across principal component 1. Furthermore, across the second principal component, the non-infected control wounds are segregated from the <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic>-infected wounds. Thus, genome-wide gene expression discriminates biological replicates, wound harvest times, and infection status.</p>
<p>Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between infected and non-infected wounds were identified from the raw RNA-Seq read count data using DESeq2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165312.ref019">19</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0165312.s005">S1 File</xref>). The fewest DEGs were found at the earliest post-infection time, 2 hrs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165312.g005">Fig 5B &amp; 5C</xref>). By 24 hrs post-infection, coincident with the peak level of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic> viable counts, the DEG counts of the wound tissue were greatest, nearly 40-fold more than at 2 hrs post-infection. In wounds infected for 24 hrs and then treated with Ciloxan, the DEGs were subsequently reduced on day 5 to about half the number as before Ciloxan treatment. This drop in DEGs by half coincided with a 10-fold reduction in viable <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> and ~3-fold lower neutrophils than at 24 hrs post-infection. Additionally, the epithelial gap was fully open in infected cells, although it was closed by half in non-infected control wounds; thus, the day-5 DEGs also reflect the delayed healing of infected wounds, whereas at 2, 6 and 24 hrs, the DEGs mostly reflect the acute response to active infection.</p>
<p>From days 5 to 9, the DEGs dropped ~3-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165312.g005">Fig 5B</xref>) despite <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic> viable counts increasing ~10-fold, likely because these viable cells in mature biofilm on day 9 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165312.g004">Fig 4</xref>) were shielded from direct contact with immune and cutaneous cells, resulting in a lower grade inflammatory response, as described below. Additionally, the fewer DEGs on day 9 probably reflect both control and infected wounds being partially re-epithelialized, unlike on day 5 when control wounds had started to close but infected wounds were fully open (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165312.g007">Fig 7</xref>).</p>

<title>Upregulation of immune-related and downregulation of skin-enriched genes in infected wounds</title>
<p>At all post-infection times, the infection induced more up-regulated than down-regulated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165312.g005">Fig 5B &amp; 5C</xref>), which may be partially due to infiltrating leukocytes (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165312.g006">Fig 6</xref>).

These results suggest that in response to the infection/inflammation that characteristically includes low oxygen and nutrients and oxidative damage, transcription in cutaneous cells is largely suppressed, but is activated when the stress subsides, such as on day 5 when the wounds may have been prepared to close and on day 9 when they had started to close.</p>

<title>ncRNA down-regulation in resident cutaneous cells is an early response to active infection, but after biofilm formed and inflammation subsided, they became up-regulated</title>
<p>At 2 hrs after infection, there was a total of 37 significantly down-regulated genes, and surprisingly, 36 were ncRNA (annotated in Ensemb, GRCh38.p5l) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165312.ref022">22</xref>]. Since within our dataset of 14370 annotated genes there are only 525 ncRNA genes, they are highly overrepresented at this earliest time post-infection (Fisher's exact test: p = 3.2e-44, odds ratio = 892). Non-coding RNA genes were also overrepresented among the down-regulated genes at 6 and 24 hrs post-infection, although as the infection intensified over 24 hrs, the proportion of ncRNA genes to protein-coding genes dropped (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165312.g009">Fig 9A</xref>). Nonetheless, during acute infection at 2, 6, or 24 hrs post-infection, all of the ncRNA that were significantly differentially expressed were down-regulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165312.g009">Fig 9B</xref>). This down-regulation of ncRNAs likely occurred in the resident cutaneous cells, not in infiltrating cells, because as compared to non-infected control wounds, cells that infiltrate infected wounds contribute transcripts.</p>

That the differentially expressed ncRNA were all down-regulated during acute infection (2, 6, and 24 hrs), were partially up-regulated at day 5, and were all up-regulated on day 9 was also seen as a trend for the pool of all 120 ncRNA significantly differentially expressed at least at a single time point (therefore p-values at some time points were non-significant; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165312.g009">Fig 9C, 9D and 9E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0165312.s008">S4 File</xref>).

<title>Differential expression of ncRNA types during acute infection</title>
<p>At 2 hrs post-infection, the 36 down-regulated ncRNA of cutaneous cells were largely unique to this time point, with only 4 being differentially expressed at another time point. In contrast, these differed from the subsequently down-regulated ncRNA at 6 and 24 hrs that largely overlapped with each other (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0165312.s008">S4 File</xref>). The initial ncRNAs down-regulated at 2 hrs were mostly small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNA, both H/ACA and C/D Box classes), miRNA, scaRNA (small Cajal body-specific RNAs), as well as small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) that were largely RNU6 pseudogenes and whose downregulation preceded the downregulation of skin-enriched genes (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165312.g008">Fig 8B</xref>). Subsequently, at 6 and 24 hrs post-infection, coincident with the suppression of skin-enriched genes, a different set of snoRNA and snRNA were down-regulated and the snRNA largely consisted of components of the major and minor spliceosomes.</p>
<p>Among all ncRNA types, snoRNAs were most frequently down-regulated in the actively infected wounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165312.g010">Fig 10</xref>). Most snoRNAs are processed intron fragments and function to guide chemical modifications of other RNAs, mainly ribosomal RNAs, transfer RNAs (tRNAs), and small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165312.ref024">24</xref>]. The snoRNAs classified as H/ACA Box and C/D Box differ in the chemical modifications they guide. Somewhat more H/ACA Box than C/D Box snoRNAs were down-regulated, but the counts of the members of both classes that were down-regulated increased as the acute infection intensified, coincident with the suppression of skin-enriched gene expression. In contrast, the counts of the down-regulated snRNAs and miRNAs trended toward a reduction as the acute infection intensified from 2 to 24 hrs.</p>

<title>ncRNAs of control wounds increased over post-wounding day 3 (from 2 to 24 hrs) and then fell, while ncRNAs of infected wounds did not increase until post-wounding day 8 (post-infection day 5) and then increased further on post-wounding day 12 (post-infection day 9)</title>
<p>As described above, at post-infection hours 2, 6, and 24, on the third post-wounding day, resident cutaneous cells of infected wounds expressed fewer transcripts of multiple specific ncRNAs of the major ncRNA types relative to non-infected control wounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165312.g009">Fig 9B</xref>, combined types; and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165312.g010">Fig 10</xref>, types analyzed separately). This differential expression could have come from a post-infection decrease in infected-wound ncRNAs or from a post-infection increase in control-wound ncRNAs. To assess which of these possibilities predominated, we analyzed raw sequence counts of the ncRNAs for infected and control wounds separately. At 2 hrs, the counts of several types of ncRNA were lower in infected wounds than non-infected wounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165312.g011">Fig 11</xref>), consistent with their calculated differential expression. However, between 2 and 24 hrs, the counts of ncRNAs of infected wounds stayed constant, while they increased in control wounds, such that the significant down-regulation of ncRNAs of acutely infected wounds, relative to control wounds, is largely accounted for by control-wound ncRNAs increasing. Following this initial suppression during active infection, the ncRNAs increased from the 24 hrs to the 9 days, while in the non-infected control wounds they decreased, such that by day 9, the infected wounds had significantly higher expression of these ncRNAs that were differentially expressed at one or more time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165312.g011">Fig 11B</xref>). We used RT-PCR to validate these ncRNA levels. Several of the ncRNA could not be validated by RT-PCR because they contained more than one isoform (SNORA1, RNU6-1136P and RNU6-1144P); however, the trends for other ncRNAs were validated (SNORA16 and MIR214; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0165312.s012">S1 Table</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We hypothesized that insights into the wound response to <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> active and biofilm infections could be gained by analyzing the combined transcriptomes of the multiple cell types of the wound. We found that the genes that were down-regulated in infected compared to sham-infected wounds on post-wound day 3 at 2 hrs post-infection were nearly all ncRNAs. Subsequently, as the active infection intensified over the next 24 hrs, protein-coding genes also became down-regulated, but ncRNAs remained overrepresented among all down-regulated genes (non-coding and protein-coding). Interestingly, the ncRNAs suppressed at 2 hrs were different than those suppressed at 6 and 24 hrs, and at these two later times, the ncRNAs mostly overlapped and included the building blocks of the major and minor spliceosomes.</p>
<p>The differentially-expressed ncRNAsâ€™ raw sequence counts (used to calculate the differential expression) increased in non-infected control wounds, but stayed constant in the acutely infected wounds, indicating that infection suppressed the increase in ncRNAs that occurred in the control wounds that received only PBS on post-wounding day 3. Subsequently, as biofilm formed in the infected wounds, the ncRNAs increased (on days 5 and 9), but decreased in control wounds, such that on day 9, the ncRNA counts of infected wounds, which were half open, exceeded those of the control wounds, which were nearly closed.</p>
<p>We were surprised that ncRNAs increased in wounds on post-wounding day 3 between 2 and 6 hours after they received only PBS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0165312.s010">S6 File</xref>). This phenomenon may have resulted from the PBS providing moisture and pH buffer that stimulated healing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165312.ref025">25</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165312.ref027">27</xref>]. Consistent with this hypothesis, protein-coding genes expressed more at 6 hrs than at 2 hrs in these PBS-treated control wounds were overrepresented among gene sets associated with activated 'formation of skin' as well as 'differentiation of skin' (Ingenuity Pathway Analysis, p-value 1.31E-10 and p-value 1.43E-05, respectively); and, their predicted top activated upstream regulator was the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Thus, between 2 and 6 hrs after receiving PBS on day 3, the increase in transcript counts of multiple classes of ncRNA may coincide with a shift from the inflammation phase to the proliferation phase of healing.</p>
<p>The gene expression program undoubtedly shifted in cells of control wounds as they closed between 2 hrs and 5 days post-PBS treatment. During this time their ncRNA counts first rose from 2 to 24 hrs, then they fell by day 5, when the wounds were already half closed. In contrast, infected wounds apparently failed to fully transition to the proliferation phase, as they were still fully open on day 5. And from 2 to 24 hrs post-infection, their ncRNA transcripts did not change, but then rose on day 5, and then again on 9. This rise in ncRNA transcripts as the infected wounds attempted to close may hypothetically be due to keratinocytes at the wound edge continuously trying to proliferate and migrate in the face of biofilm, similar to the situation in chronic diabetic ulcers wherein keratinocytes are highly proliferative but lack markers of migration and epidermal differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165312.ref028">28</xref>]. Thus, as the wounds became chronically infected with biofilm, the coincident increase in ncRNA transcripts might reflect wound cells repeatedly exiting the metabolically-suppressed inflammation state to proliferate, mostly futilely.</p>
<p>The down-regulated C/D Box snoRNA transcripts at 2 hrs post-infection had a size distribution like all annotated C/D Box snoRNA genes, while at 6 and 24 hrs, there was a shift in the distribution to include longer less abundant C/D Box snoRNAs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0165312.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). A similar temporal shift in sizes was observed for snRNA: at 2 hrs, the differentially-expressed snRNAs were mostly RNU6 pseudogenes, an abundant class of snRNA with unknown function; while at 6 and 24 hrs, the down-regulated snRNA were larger and consisted mostly of the snRNA building blocks of the major and minor spliceosomes. These snRNAs have been previously shown to be down-regulated in response to intracellular infection with <italic>Shigella</italic>, which affected spliceosomal snRNA maturation, dependent on the activation of a metabolic stress pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165312.ref029">29</xref>]. Our studies suggest the possibility of a similar effect in response to <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> infection, and the altered expression of the major and minor spliceosome components could possibly influence alternative splicing, as previously suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165312.ref030">30</xref>].</p>
<p>In infected wounds on post-wounding day 3, the suppressed ncRNA transcripts could potentially be a byproduct of the stress-induced inhibition of translation, or could alternatively function as a checkpoint in the regulation of the stress-response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165312.ref029">29</xref>]. The integrated-stress-response pathway starts with a general shutdown and reprogramming of protein synthesis and involves reprogrammed transcription for overcoming stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165312.ref006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165312.ref023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165312.ref031">31</xref>]. In our study, early at 2 hrs after <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> infection, a lowering of ncRNAs preceded the up-regulation of the stress-activated transcription factors, ATF3 and ATF6, and the down-regulation of skin-enriched genes at 6 and 24 hrs.</p>
<p>Non-coding RNAs have been shown to play a role in stress-responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165312.ref032">32</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165312.ref035">35</xref>]. For example, the stress sensor PKR (protein kinase RNA-activated), long known to be activated by viral dsRNA, was activated by snoRNA in response to metabolic stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165312.ref036">36</xref>]. Additionally, miRNAs function in stress responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165312.ref037">37</xref>], being enriched along with their mRNA targets, Argonaute, and miRNA-protein complex components in stress granules, which form in response to various environmental stresses and translation inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165312.ref023">23</xref>]. The formation of stress granules can be triggered by the phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2Î±, which is governed by five stress-sensing kinases, one being the stress sensor PKR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165312.ref037">37</xref>]. Stress granules are often detected docked to P-bodiesâ€”cytoplasmic structures containing small mRNAs, proteins, and ncRNAs associated with post-transcriptional regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165312.ref038">38</xref>], which have been implicated in the regulation of RNA metabolism during viral and bacterial infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165312.ref039">39</xref>]. The ncRNA patterns we have identified could reflect such processes and provide clues to transcriptional regulatory pathways underlying responses to stress and changes in cell states.</p>
<p>There are many limitations and uncertainties in interpreting transcriptomic data of a tissueâ€™s heterogeneous cell populations in mixture. In our experiments, we interpret the down-regulated genes during acute infection (2 to 24 hrs post-infection) to have been down-regulated in the resident cutaneous cells, rather than in the infiltrating cells, because the infiltrating cells contribute transcripts to the infected wounds as compared to control wounds. An alternative interpretation is that infiltrating cells dilute the RNA of the wound tissue, making its gene expression appear to be generally down-regulated. Such an effect appears not to explain our results because at 2 hrs post-infection, gene expression was not down-regulated in general, rather, ncRNAs were preferentially down-regulated, and they remained over-represented among down-regulated genes at 6 and 24 hrs post-infection. Also, the set of ncRNAs at 2 hrs post-infection switched to a different set at 6 and 24 hrs post-infection which largely overlapped. Additionally, the counts of some down-regulated ncRNA classes decreased (snRNA and miRNA) between 2 and 24 hrs although the number of infiltrating cells increased. Furthermore, between 6 and 24 hrs post-infection, the skin-enriched protein-coding genes were down-regulated ~4.5 fold, while infiltrating PMNs increased only ~2-fold.</p>
<sec id="sec018">
<title>Conclusions and hypotheses</title>
<p>Our data show that at 3 days post-wounding, the genes down-regulated soonest after infection, at 2 hrs post-infection, were nearly exclusively ncRNAs, and they were down-regulated prior to the general down-regulation of skin-enriched coding gene expression at 6 and 24 hrs post-infection. This result suggests the hypothesis that the ncRNAs that are down-regulated soon after infection are part of a mechanism that regulates the response of resident cutaneous cells to infection. Additionally, in non-infected wounds, from 2 to 24 hrs after the day 3 wounds received the PBS vehicle alone (i.e., sham-infection), the raw counts of the differentially expressed ncRNA transcripts increased, but they did not increase in the wounds with biofilm infection until later when they were starting to close. This result suggests the hypothesis that these ncRNAs may be part of a mechanism for regulating changes between cell states, such that from the metabolically suppressed state of inflammation to the proliferation phase of wound healing.</p>

<title>Animal protocol</title>
<p>Adult female New Zealand white rabbits (3-5kg) from Charles River Laboratories International, Inc. were acclimated to standard housing, fed ad libitum, and kept in individual cages under constant temperature (22Â°C) and humidity with a 12-hour light dark cycle. A total of 89 animals were used for this study. Two biological repeats were used for each time point, except for the 5-day post-infection time point that used 3 biological repeats. A preemptive dose of analgesic Buprenorphine HCL SR (Zoopharm; 0.3â€“0.5 mg/kg) was administered subcutaneously 15 minutes earlier to the anesthetic induction. Thereafter, it was administered as needed, based on the clinical assessment of pain and/or distress. Prior to the surgery for creating full-thickness dermal wounds, rabbits were anesthetized by intramuscular injection of a mixture of ketamine (22.5mg/kg) and xylazine (3.5mg/kg). Ears were shaved, sterilized with a betadine scrub and 70% ethanol and injected intradermally with 1% lidocaine with epinephrine before making six 6-mm-diameter full-thickness dermal wounds down to the perichondrium on the ventral surface, which were then dressed with Tegaderm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165312.ref040">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165312.ref041">41</xref>]. After wounding, the animals were randomized into two groups: vehicle control (non-infected) and infected. Each biological repeat at 2, 6, and 24 hrs post-sham-infection (control groups) consisted of 3 animals, while for the infected groups they consisted of 5 animals. At days 5 and 9, the biological repeats consisted of 3 animals for non-infected, while the infected groups consisted of 4 animals. The number of animals used for each biological repeat for each time point is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0165312.s013">S2 Table</xref>. On post-wounding day (PWD) 3, the Tegaderm was removed, and wounds of the infected group received 10<sup>6</sup> <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic> CFU in 10 Î¼l PBS, while non-infected control wounds received just PBS. Wounds of both groups were subsequently re-dressed with Tegaderm. On PWD 4, wounds were treated with topical Ciloxan to select for biofilm (in the infected wounds). On PWD 5, the Tegaderm was removed and replaced with TELFA<sup>â„¢</sup>AMD<sup>â„¢</sup>, an antimicrobial non-adherent dressing, which was changed on post-wounding days 6, 8 and 10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165312.ref006">6</xref>]. For studying active infection, wounds were harvested at post-infection times 2, 6, and 24 hours. For studying biofilm infection, the Ciloxan-treated wounds were harvested on post-infection days 5 and 9. At each wound harvest time, animals were euthanized by intravenous injection of a euthanasia solution (Fatal-Plus TM). All animals were monitored minimum of twice daily for general appearance, behavior, and signs of wound infection. Body weight was obtained daily as part of their assessment of pain and/or distress. All dressings were checked every day throughout the entire protocol.</p>

<title>Total RNA extraction</title>
<p>The dorsal skin of the ear was removed prior to harvesting the wound using an 8-mm punch. The harvested tissue was immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. To obtain total RNA, the frozen tissues were homogenized in TRIzol (Life Technologies) using the T25 ULTRATURRAX at 20,000rpm (IKA, Germany). The RNA was purified using an RNEasy Mini-Kit (Qiagen, MD). Genomic DNA was removed by treatment with DNAse I (Ambion), and the absence of DNA contamination was confirmed using a control without reverse transcriptase and demonstrating a Ct value 10 cycles higher than the reverse transcribed samples. The RNA was quantified (A260/A280, NanoDrop, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) and checked for purity (2200 TapeStation, Agilent Technologies, Cedar Creek, TX). The purified RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA using the iScript Select cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). The RNA was isolated from seven of the 12, 8-mm biopsy punches of the wounds (to include the wound edges) harvested from each animal. The remaining five were used for viable counts, SEM, epithelial gap and immunohistochemistry. The RNA from each wound was individually isolated and the purity was checked before pooling. Each RNA sequence determination was from RNA pooled from 28â€“30 infected wounds or 18â€“21 non-infected wounds.</p>

<title>Histology and immunohistochemistry</title>
<p>Wounds excised with a 10-mm punch were bisected at their largest diameter, fixed in formalin, embedded in paraffin, cut into 4.5-Î¼m sections, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) for subsequent light microscopy (Nikon, Eclipse 55i and the attached Nis-Element BR 4.13.00, Japan). The histomorphometric parameter, epithelial gap (EG), for evaluating wound healing, was determined as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165312.ref041">41</xref>]. For immunohistochemistry, the formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections were deparaffinized with xylene and rehydrated through 100, 95, and 70% ethanol followed by incubation in deionized water for 5 minutes. They were then incubated in 100 mM glycine for 10 min before being blocked for 1 hr with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in Tris-buffered saline. PMNs staining was done by using a mouse anti-rabbit RPN3/57 antibody (sc-59376; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA) that was directly conjugated with a fluorochrome (Readilink antibody labeling kit Bio Rad, CA) to minimize non-specific staining. The sections were incubated in the conjugated antibody (1:100) for 2 hours at room temperature. To stain monocytes and macrophages, we used the mouse anti-macrophage antibody MAC387 (ab22506; Abcam) (1:20) vs. the control, mouse IgG (H+L) (Life Technologies), for 1 hour at room temperature, at a final concentration of (1:500). To stain M1 and M2 Macrophages, Anti-HLA DR (for M1; LN-3, Abcam) and anti-human CD206 (for M2, MCA2155, AbD Serotec) mouse antibodies were used, which were directly labeled using Qdot Secondary Antibody Conjugates (Life Technologies, CA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165312.ref044">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0165312.ref045">45</xref>].
