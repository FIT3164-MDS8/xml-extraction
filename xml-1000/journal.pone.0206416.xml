<abstract>
<p>Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS), caused by SFTS virus (SFTSV), is a viral hemorrhagic fever with a high case fatality rate. Favipiravir was reported to be effective in the treatment of SFTSV infection <italic>in vivo</italic> in type I interferon receptor knockout (IFNAR<sup>−/−</sup>) mice at treatment dosages of both 60 mg/kg/day and 300 mg/kg/day for a duration of 5 days. In this study, the efficacy of favipiravir at dosages of 120 mg/kg/day and 200 mg/kg/day against SFTSV infection in an IFNAR<sup>−/−</sup> mouse infection model was investigated. IFNAR<sup>−/−</sup> mice were subcutaneously infected with SFTSV at a 1.0 × 10<sup>6</sup> 50% tissue culture infectious dose followed by twice daily administration of favipiravir, comprising a total dose of either 120 mg/kg/day or 200 mg/kg/day. The treatment was initiated either immediately post infection or at predesignated time points post infection. Neutralizing antibodies in the convalescent-phase mouse sera was examined by the pseudotyped VSV system. All mice treated with favipiravir at dosages of 120 mg/kg/day or 200 mg/kg/day survived when the treatment was initiated at no later than 4 days post infection. A decrease in body weight of mice was observed when the treatment was initiated at 3–4 days post infection. Furthermore, all control mice died. The body weight of mice did not decrease when treatment with favipiravir was initiated immediately post infection at dosages of 120 mg/kg/day and 200 mg/kg/day. Neutralizing antibodies were detected in the convalescent-phase mouse sera. Similar to the literature-reported peritoneal administration of favipiravir at 300 mg/kg/day, the oral administration of favipiravir at dosages of 120 mg/kg/day and 200 mg/kg/day to IFNAR<sup>−/−</sup> mice infected with SFTSV was effective.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is caused by SFTS virus (SFTSV), belonging to the family <italic>Phenuiviridae</italic> (genus <italic>Phlebovirus</italic>). SFTS is a viral hemorrhagic fever with a high case fatality rate; it was first reported as a novel infectious disease in China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206416.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206416.ref002">2</xref>], followed by discovery in South Korea and Japan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206416.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206416.ref004">4</xref>]. It is characterized by marked reduction in platelet, white blood cell, and total blood cell counts in patients. Hemorrhagic symptoms, such as gingival oozing, bloody diarrhea, and hematuria, are commonly observed in patients with severe and fatal SFTS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206416.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206416.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206416.ref006">6</xref>]. Because of the associated high mortality rate, it is critical to develop specific and effective therapy for SFTS. Unfortunately, no such treatment has been developed yet. The inhibitory effect of ribavirin on the replication of SFTSV has been elucidated <italic>in vitro</italic> as well as <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206416.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206416.ref008">8</xref>]. Although ribavirin inhibited the replication of SFTSV <italic>in vitro</italic> in a dose-dependent manner, therapeutic effect <italic>in vivo</italic> was limited in comparison with that of favipiravir. Thus, an anti-SFTSV effect of ribavirin is limited or absent in the clinical setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206416.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206416.ref010">10</xref>]. Favipiravir is an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitor and a potent broad-spectrum antiviral drug. It inhibits the replication of multiple families of RNA viruses <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206416.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206416.ref012">12</xref>]. Favipiravir is a therapeutic antiviral drug against influenza virus approved in Japan with strict regulations for its production and clinical use. However, during the 2014–2015 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, it was also considered as a candidate agent against Ebola virus infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206416.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206416.ref014">14</xref>]. In addition, favipiravir was demonstrated to have antiviral effects against the newly discovered emerging viruses SFTSV and Heartland virus (HRTV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206416.ref015">15</xref>]. HRTV is an emerging tick-borne virus, which, similar to SFTSV, belongs to the genus <italic>Phlebovirus</italic> in the family <italic>Phenuiviridae</italic>. Patients infected with HRTV show similar symptoms as SFTS patients. The efficacy of favipiravir against HRTV infections was demonstrated in animal infection models using STAT2 knockout hamsters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206416.ref015">15</xref>].</p>
<p>Reportedly, favipiravir is effective when administered even after symptoms appeared. The antiviral effects of favipiravir against SFTSV were confirmed in a mouse model as well as STAT2 knockout hamster model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206416.ref016">16</xref>]. We have previously demonstrated the antiviral effects of favipiravir against SFTSV in a lethal mouse model using IFNAR<sup>−/−</sup> mice. In the study, the highest dose of favipiravir used in mice experiments, at which side effects did not appear, was 300 mg/kg/day via intraperitoneal (i.p.) route. All mice treated with favipiravir at 300 mg/kg/day survived without showing any symptoms upon SFTSV infection. In the mouse model, all mice also survived when treated i.p. with favipiravir at 60 mg/kg/day. However, their body weight decreased by approximately 10% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206416.ref008">8</xref>]. In the present study, the efficacy of favipiravir in the mouse lethal model was evaluated at dosages of 120 mg/kg/day via oral administration (p.o.) and 200 mg/kg/day p.o. The two doses of favipiravir were selected in clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy of favipiravir against influenza virus infections in humans. Favipiravir dosages of 120 mg/kg/day p.o. and 200 mg/kg/day p.o. have been applied for the restricted approval in Japan. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of favipiravir at dosages of 120 mg/kg/day p.o. and 200 mg/kg/day p.o. in the treatment of SFTSV infection in the lethal mouse model using IFNAR<sup>−/−</sup> mice.</p>

<p>IFNAR<sup>−/−</sup> C57BL/6 mice were produced as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206416.ref008">8</xref>]. IFNAR<sup>−/−</sup> C57BL/6 mice were bred and maintained in an environmentally controlled specific pathogen-free animal facility of the NIID. Eight- to 10-week-old male mice were used. Favipiravir was administered in mice using a stomach probe after subcutaneous inoculation (s.c.) with 1.0 × 10<sup>6</sup> 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID<sub>50</sub>) of SFTSV in 100 μl DMEM.

Blood samples (20 μl/animal) were obtained via tail vein puncture at intervals of 2–4 days over a period of 14 days (&lt;4 blood drawings in total) for the measurement of viral RNA levels. Body weight was recorded daily for 2 weeks, and each mouse was monitored daily for the development of clinical symptoms such as hunched posture, ruffled fur, activity, response to stimuli, and neurological signs. When mice showed serious clinical symptoms or weight loss of more than 30%, they were considered to be reached the humane endpoint so that they were humanely euthanized.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We have previously demonstrated the protective efficacy of favipiravir in the treatment of SFTSV infection at dosages of 300 mg/kg/day i.p. in the lethal mouse model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206416.ref008">8</xref>]. Since favipiravir is approved for anti-influenza drug as a formula of p.o. drug in Japan, we have tested the efficacy of favipiravir at dosages of 120 mg/kg/day and 200 mg/kg/day p.o. against SFTSV in the lethal mouse model. The results demonstrated favipiravir at both dosages were effective via oral administration. The dosages were the standard dose applicable in humans. For utilizing favipiravir as an anti-influenza drug in humans, a dosage of 120 mg/kg/day p.o. has been set for clinical use in Japan. With regard to the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak that occurred in West Africa in 2013–2015, favipiravir was required to be administered at a higher dose for the treatment of EVD than that required for the treatment of influenza. This was based on the higher IC<sub>50</sub> values of favipiravir for Ebola virus <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206416.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206416.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206416.ref020">20</xref>].</p>
<p>The effective concentration of favipiravir in blood is considered to be similar when administered p.o. and when administered i.p. since several hours post administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206416.ref021">21</xref>]. Here the therapeutic effect of favipiravir in the treatment of SFTSV infection was observed both when administered p.o. as well as when administered i.p. In contrast to the previous reports, where favipiravir was administered once a day, favipiravir was administered twice a day (BID) in the present study. The antiviral effects of favipiravir when administered orally at the tested doses might be higher than those when administered via the intraperitoneal route quaque die [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206416.ref008">8</xref>]. This difference may be attributed to the maintenance of effective favipiravir concentration in blood. Furthermore, it is speculated that the observed therapeutic effect might be obtained not only due to a direct inhibition of viral replication by favipiravir but also due to the production of neutralizing antibodies against SFTSV in the later phase of the disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206416.g003">Fig 3</xref>). The neutralizing antibody responses were higher in mice wherein treatment was initiated on Days 1 and 2 than in those wherein treatment was initiated on Day 0. This may be attributed to the amount of replicated virus as an antigen. Conversely, the production of neutralizing antibodies was weak in mice wherein treatment was initiated on Day 5, suggesting that neutralizing antibody producing cells were more heavily damaged in mice wherein the treatment was initiated in the later stages of the disease.</p>
<p>The therapeutic effect of favipiravir is remarkably higher against SFTS in animal models than other reported viral infectious diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206416.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206416.ref022">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206416.ref023">23</xref>]. Administration of favipiravir after the onset of the disease did not show any efficacy in the treatment of EVD or Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever viral infection in animal models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206416.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206416.ref022">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206416.ref023">23</xref>]. Conversely, the administration of favipiravir in the mice infected with SFTSV within 4 days post infection showed efficacy even at a dosage of 120 mg/kg/day, which is the dosage approved to be prescribed to humans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206416.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Therefore, favipiravir was effective not only for prophylactic use but also for treating SFTS in the mouse model. However, it was too late to initiate the administration of favipiravir at Day 5 in the mice model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206416.g002">Fig 2</xref>). The results obtained in the present study indicate that favipiravir should be administered as early as possible post infection. This also indicates that favipiravir should be administered as early as possible from disease onset for the treatment of patients with SFTS.</p>
<p>Currently, there is no antiviral therapy available for the treatment of SFTSV infection. Here, we studied the efficacy of favipiravir at dosages of 120 mg/kg/day p.o. and 200 mg/kg/day p.o. in the treatment of mice infected with SFTSV. These dosages can also be applied to humans. Currently, clinical trials are underway for evaluating the efficacy of favipiravir in the treatment of patients with SFTS in Japan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206416.ref024">24</xref>]. We hope that favipiravir will not only be used as a prophylactic drug against SFTS in the near future but also as a therapeutic drug in clinical practice.</p>
