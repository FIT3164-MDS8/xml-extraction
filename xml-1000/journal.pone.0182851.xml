<abstract>
<p>Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic lung disease characterized by cellular phenotype alterations and deposition of extracellular matrix proteins. The alternative activation of macrophages in the lungs has been associated as a major factor promoting pulmonary fibrosis, however the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are poorly understood. In the present study, we have defined a molecular mechanism by which signals transmitted from the extracellular matrix via the α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>1</sub> integrin lead to the activation of Rac2 which regulates alternative macrophage differentiation, a signaling axis within the pulmonary macrophage compartment required for bleomycin induced pulmonary fibrosis. Mice deficient in Rac2 were protected against bleomycin-induced fibrosis and displayed diminished collagen deposition in association with lower expression of alternatively activated profibrotic macrophage markers. We have demonstrated a macrophage autonomous process by which the injection of M2 and not M1 macrophages restored the bleomycin induced pulmonary fibrosis susceptibility in Rac2-/- mice, establishing a critical role for a macrophage Rac2 signaling axis in the regulation of macrophage differentiation and lung fibrosis <italic>in vivo</italic>. We also demonstrate that markers of alternative macrophage activation are increased in patients with IPF. Taken together, these studies define an important role for an integrin-driven Rac2 signaling axis in macrophages, and reveal that Rac2 activation is required for polarization of macrophages towards a profibrotic phenotype and progression of pulmonary fibrosis <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic and fatal disease characterized by fibrotic remodeling of lung parenchyma followed by progressive decline in lung function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0182851.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0182851.ref002">2</xref>]. IPF may be initiated by intrinsic and extrinsic cellular stress which lead to activation of fibroblasts, disruption of alveolar architecture, and deposition of extracellular matrix proteins, resulting in impaired gas exchange and respiratory failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0182851.ref003">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0182851.ref005">5</xref>]. The role of inflammation and immune dysregulation has been suggested as a major factor in the initiation and progression of pulmonary fibrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0182851.ref006">6</xref>].</p>
<p>Recent reports have highlighted that a discrete type of macrophage activation known as M2 or alternative activation is associated with the progression of IPF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0182851.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0182851.ref008">8</xref>]. Classical/M1 macrophage activation by Th1 cytokines and/or microbial agents, induces the production of interleukin 12 (IL12). Alternatively, macrophages stimulated by Th2 cytokines comprise the M2 phenotype which plays a critical role in wound healing and tumor progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0182851.ref009">9</xref>]. M2 macrophages express higher levels of mannose receptor (MRC-1, CD206), and scavenging receptor CD163 as they differentiate from monocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0182851.ref010">10</xref>]. It is widely accepted that M2 terminology encompasses functionally diverse group of macrophages and can be further subdivided into M2a, M2b and M2c macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0182851.ref009">9</xref>]. However, in reality, these <italic>in vitro</italic> concepts have been difficult to match to tissue macrophages <italic>in situ</italic>, due to lack of specific markers for these phenotypes within the tissue and numerous reports suggesting that macrophages exist as distinct entities <italic>in situ</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0182851.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0182851.ref012">12</xref>]. Numerous studies point to the role of alternatively activated M2 macrophages in lung fibrosis in mouse models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0182851.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0182851.ref013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0182851.ref015">15</xref>] and in human IPF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0182851.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0182851.ref016">16</xref>]. M2 macrophages are capable of generating pro-fibrotic mediators, but this phenotype is ineffective to support the host defense role provided by the classically activated M1 macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0182851.ref010">10</xref>]. In addition to a profibrotic role, this shift in macrophage phenotype in IPF patients may provide an explanation for why these patients get frequent lung infections, which leads to pulmonary failure and ultimately death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0182851.ref017">17</xref>]. Therefore, targeting the M2 macrophage phenotype is an attractive potential therapeutic strategy for lung fibrosis, as this phenotype produces high levels of growth factors and pro-fibrotic cytokines <italic>in vitro</italic>, which might contribute to the persistence of the fibrotic microenvironment. Although previous studies shed light on the molecular entities involved in alternative activation of MΘs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0182851.ref018">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0182851.ref021">21</xref>], the critical signal transduction pathways that control the M1-M2 transition in lung fibrosis remain to be determined. If these pathways can be identified, they may serve as targets for therapeutic exploitation in lung fibrosis dependent upon M2 MΘs.</p>
<p>The role of Rac2, a small GTPase in hematopoietic and endothelial cell integrin and immunoreceptor signaling, is well documented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0182851.ref022">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0182851.ref024">24</xref>]. Recently, our laboratory has shown that Rac2-/- mice are defective in tumor growth and the absence of Rac2 skews macrophages towards classical M1 activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0182851.ref024">24</xref>]. Disruption of the gene encoding Rac2 led to attenuated lung inflammation and injury in a model of immune complex-mediated acute lung injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0182851.ref025">25</xref>]. A small molecule inhibitor of Rac1 and Rac2 also reported to alleviate LPS induced acute lung injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0182851.ref026">26</xref>]. A study by Arizmendi <italic>et al</italic> has shown that Rac2 promotes bleomycin induced lung injury, however the molecular mechanism remains unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0182851.ref027">27</xref>]. In the present study, we investigated the mechanism by which Rac2 regulates fibrogenesis in a bleomycin induced model of pulmonary fibrosis. Our data demonstrate a novel signaling pathway within the lung fibrotic milieu downstream of the extracellular matrix and the α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>1</sub> integrin in which Rac2 is <underline>necessary and sufficient</underline> to control alternative macrophage activation in the setting of bleomycin induced lung injury. We suggest that further analysis of the genetic and/or epigenetic alterations observed in the Rac2 -/- model which abrogate fibrosis and the M2 phenotype may contribute to understanding the process of lung fibrogenesis observed in IPF and suggest new targets for therapeutic exploitation.</p>

<title>Animals</title>
<p>Rac2-/- mice (backcrossed &gt;50 generations into C57BL/6J background) and genotyping have been previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0182851.ref023">23</xref>]. Integrin α4Y991A mice were a gift from Dr. Mark Ginsberg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0182851.ref028">28</xref>]. α4Y991A mice bears a point mutation in α4 integrin cytoplasmic tail (Y991A) and are reported to show a deficit in recruitment of leukocytes to inflammatory sites with no defect in recruitment of neutrophils. For our experiments, we used female animals at 8–10 weeks of age. C57BL/6 animals were used as controls. All procedures involving animals were approved by the University of California San Diego Animal Care Committee, which serves to ensure that all federal guidelines concerning animal experimentation are met.</p>

<title>Bleomycin induced pulmonary fibrosis</title>
<p>WT, Rac2-/- and α4Y991A mice were anesthetized with intraperitoneal injections of ketamine and xylazine (100 and 10 mg/kg body mass, respectively). Mice were administered an intratracheal instillation of 0.05 U of bleomycin sulphate (Sigma) (3 U/Kg body weight, dissolved in normal saline) or normal saline using Micro Sprayer MS-IA-1C (Penn-Century). Following the bleomycin instillation, mice were monitored daily for morbidity and mortality. Groups of WT, Rac2-/- and α4Y991A mice (<italic>n</italic> = 5 to 10 per time point) were sacrificed and their lung tissues were analyzed on day 3, 7 and 28 after bleomycin injection.</p>

<p>For murine lung histology, control and bleomycin instilled WT, Rac2-/- and α4Y991A were euthanized on day 28. The thoracic cavity was dissected to expose the lungs, tracheae were cannulated, and 1.0–1.5 ml of 10% buffered formalin in PBS (pH 7.2) was gently instilled by syringe through the cannula into the lungs. Lungs were inflated to the original dimensions of the thoracic cavity. After instillation of buffered formalin, lungs were stored in 10% buffered formaldehyde for 24 h and then processed for histological studies. For OCT embedding, the lungs were inflated similarly with OCT sucrose mixture and stored at -80°C. Lungs were sectioned at 4 μm followed by hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining or Sirius red staining, or with antibodies for α-smooth muscle actin (αSMA).</p>

<title>Rac2 is required for bleomycin induced lung fibrosis</title>
<p>Rac2 is expressed primarily in hematopoietic cells, and plays an important role in actin cytoskeletal rearrangements, superoxide production and degranulation in neutrophils and macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0182851.ref031">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0182851.ref032">32</xref>]. A previous study has shown that Rac2 mediates acute lung injury in a murine model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0182851.ref025">25</xref>]. A recent study by Arizmendi <italic>et al</italic> has shown that Rac2 null mice are protected against bleomycin lung injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0182851.ref027">27</xref>] however the molecular mechanism regulating this phenomenon remains unclear. Moreover, this study did not report alterations in lung fibrosis or any link to macrophage biology between the two experimental groups. To determine whether Rac2 was critical for the development of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis, WT and Rac2-/- mice were challenged with 3 U/Kg of bleomycin and the amount of fibrosis was measured. Administration of bleomycin by the intratracheal route induces initial inflammation and subsequent fibrosis. Fibrosis begins to develop by 14 days and usually peaks between 21–28 days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0182851.ref033">33</xref>]. In our model, administration of bleomycin (3U/kg), in WT C57BL/6 mice reliably cause fibrosis in 28 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182851.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Saline 0.9% does not induce fibrosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182851.g001">Fig 1</xref>). To quantitate fibrosis, whole lungs were harvested from WT and Rac2-/- on day 28 after bleomycin and the amount of collagen was measured by hydroxyproline assay. Whole lung samples from saline treated Rac2-/- mice exhibited similar hydroxyproline levels to those observed in WT saline. WT Bleo mice had significantly higher collagen deposition on day 28 after bleomycin challenge, as compared with saline treated mice and Rac2-/- Bleo mice, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182851.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Sirius red staining in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182851.g001">Fig 1B</xref> showed that WT and Rac2-/- saline group are similar in histological architecture. As expected, lungs of bleomycin-treated WT mice showed extensive disruption of lung architecture, obstruction of alveolar spaces, and an extended web of collagen-positive stained areas in an irregular pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182851.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). In contrast, lungs of Rac2-/- mice treated with i.t. bleomycin showed a normal histopathological lung architecture and less collagen accumulation within the lung (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182851.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Moreover, quantitation of expression of the fibrosis marker genes in the lung parenchyma of Rac2-/- vs WT mice allowed us to correlate the lung fibrotic phenotype with the augmented expression of a M2 pro-fibrotic gene signature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182851.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). These results were further supported by increased α-SMA staining in WT bleomycin treated group as compared to Rac2-/- as revealed by Western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182851.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). These data strongly support our conclusion that the deletion of the Rac2 gene in mice prevents bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis.</p>

<p>In order to investigate the role of Rac2 in bleomycin-induced lung injury, lung physiology was analyzed in the bleomycin instilled Rac2-/- vs WT mice on day 28. WT mice that received i.t. bleomycin showed significantly augmented airway resistance and elastance compared to saline treated mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0182851.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). Similar to previously published report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0182851.ref027">27</xref>] Rac2−/− mice that received bleomycin showed resistance and elastance levels that were similar to Rac2−/− or WT mice receiving saline. There was a highly significant difference in resistance and elastance between bleomycin-treated WT and Rac2−/− mice. (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0182851.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). To further understand the function of Rac2 in the long-term effects of bleomycin-induced lung injury, WT and Rac2−/− mice challenged with bleomycin were monitored for mortality up to day 28. We did not observe any mortality in WT mice by day 28. Taken together, the fibrosis and pulmonary physiology results indicate that bleomycin-induced lung pathology is markedly attenuated in Rac2−/− mice.</p>

<title>Impaired alternative activation of macrophages is associated with reduced fibrosis in Rac2-/- following bleomycin</title>
<p>Our results clearly establish a requirement for Rac2 in bleomycin induced lung fibrosis. The next question we addressed experimentally was; how does this small GTPase, which is specifically expressed in the hematopoietic compartment, modulate fibrosis and the alterations in macrophage polarization in the injured lung? One explanation for the Rac2-/- phenotype is that Rac2 is required for promoting alternative activation of M2 macrophages in the lung parenchyma following lung injury. In a recent study, we reported that Rac2-/- is required for tumor growth and M2 macrophage differentiation in tumor microenvironment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0182851.ref024">24</xref>]. Our previously published genomic and metabolomics results in cancer models suggested that Rac2-/- BMDMs are defective in M2 macrophage differentiation <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0182851.ref024">24</xref>]. On the basis of the literature suggesting role of M2 macrophages in fibrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0182851.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0182851.ref008">8</xref>] and role of Rac2 in M2 macrophage differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0182851.ref024">24</xref>] we hypothesized that Rac2-/- mice were protected from fibrosis due to a defect in alternative activation of M2 macrophages within the injured lung. To test this hypothesis, we used RT-PCR to detect the expression of M2 markers in the alveolar macrophages isolated from the BAL of bleomycin instilled WT and Rac2-/-, animals on day 28. We found that BAL derived MΘs isolated from Rac2-/- bleomycin treated mice were defective in the differentiation of macrophages into M2 phenotype as shown by RT-PCR analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182851.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Macrophages isolated from BALs of bleomycin instilled Rac2-/- mice displayed a significant downregulation in gene expression of typical M2 markers viz., YM1, Fizz1, CD206 and arginase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182851.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Importantly, both WT and Rac2-/- saline treated experimental groups did not increase the expression of these M2 genes. These results were further validated by Western blot analysis showing reduced expression of CD206, arginase and Fizz 1 in alveolar MΘs isolated from bleomycin instilled Rac2-/- mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182851.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). Consistent with these data, we observed augmented arginase activity in BAL-associated MΘs isolated from WT mice instilled with bleomycin, a result not seen in Rac2-/- BAL-associated pulmonary MΘs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182851.g002">Fig 2C</xref>).</p>

<title>Rac2-/- mice display inflammatory M1 phenotype with impaired M2 macrophage activation in late phase of bleomycin induced lung injury</title>
<p>The data presented above clearly demonstrate that Rac2-/- mice display a defect in alternative activation of M2 macrophage phenotype in bleomycin instilled mice on day 28. This observation led us to investigate the modulation of macrophage phenotypes in the early phase of lung injury in Rac2-/- mice. In order to get clear picture of how Rac2 controls early phase of lung injury, we determined the extent of early lung injury and inflammation in bleomycin instilled WT and Rac2-/- mice on day 3 and 7. There were no observed differences in BAL cell counts or albumin (indicative of vascular leak [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0182851.ref034">34</xref>]) between WT and Rac2-/- mice at day 3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0182851.s002">S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0182851.s003">S3</xref> Figs). Similar to a previous report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0182851.ref027">27</xref>], we also observed that neutrophils were reduced in bleomycin instilled Rac2-/- mice compared to WT mice on day 7, but there was no significant difference in the no. of macrophages or lymphocytes infiltrated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0182851.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). Albumin levels in bleomycin instilled Rac2-/- mice were also lower compared to WT on day 7 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0182851.s003">S3 Fig</xref>), consistent with a role of Rac2 in neutrophil-mediated transition from early to later stages of acute lung injury. Consistent with a previous report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0182851.ref027">27</xref>] our data indicate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0182851.s002">S2 Fig</xref>) that macrophage infiltration is normal in Rac2 -/- mice instilled with bleomycin on day 3 and 7. We next measured Cola1 (collagen) gene expression on days 7, 14 and 28 following bleomycin challenge. Our results showed that at day 7 there is no statistically significant increase in collagen in either genotype. However in the fibroproliferative phase at day 14 increasing collagen gene expression is manifest, with statistically higher levels in WT (p &lt; .05). (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0182851.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). Importantly, a statistically greater level of collagen expression is noted on day 28 (P &lt; .001) in WT vs Rac2-/-. The results from the time course analysis of collagen expression provides indicates that the most significant differences in fibrosis in this model occur in the later stages. These results prompted us to examine if there is any modulation in macrophage phenotypes in bleomycin challenged WT and Rac2-/- mice in the transition from acute injury to fibrosis. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182851.g003">Fig 3A</xref> illustrates that macrophages derived from BALs of bleomycin instilled WT and Rac2-/- mice display increased expression of inflammatory M1 macrophage genes viz. IL1 and IL6 in both the genotypes, with significant upregulation of IL6 in Rac2-/- mice on day 3. The expression of M2 marker genes viz. YM1, Fizz1, CD206 and arginase is similar in both WT and Rac2-/- on day 3, except YM1, which shows significant upregulation in the Rac2-/- bleomycin experimental group. It is important to state, that the expression of M2 genes is low compared to day 28 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182851.g003">Fig 3B</xref>), suggesting that in early phase of lung injury, macrophages are predominantly of inflammatory M1 phenotype. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182851.g004">Fig 4A</xref> shows massive infiltration of leukocytes into the lungs of both WT and Rac2-/- mice instilled with bleomycin on day 7 with no disruption of normal lung architecture in both genotypes. The expression of inflammatory M1 genes is high in both genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182851.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). Interestingly, the expression of anti-inflammatory M2 genes is high in WT mice instilled with bleomycin on day 7 when compared to Rac2-/- mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182851.g004">Fig 4C</xref>) and WT mice instilled with bleomycin on day 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182851.g003">Fig 3B</xref>), implicating the shift of pro inflammatory M1 macrophages to anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages in WT mice on day 7. These findings indicate that the absence of fibrosis at day 28 in Rac2-/- mice is not simply due to protection from acute lung injury, but rather suggest that a Rac2-macrophage autonomous event regulates the alternative activation of MΘ phenotype and progression to lung fibrosis <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

<title>α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>1</sub> integrin activate Rac2 and promotes pulmonary fibrosis</title>
<p>Our published results clearly establish that the α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>1</sub> integrin is a potent selective upstream stimulus for Rac2 activation in macrophages. The α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>1</sub> integrin promotes Rac2 activation, macrophage migration and M2 macrophage differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0182851.ref024">24</xref>]. Our recently published results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0182851.ref024">24</xref>] showed less Rac2-GTP activation under conditions of CSF1R/α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>1</sub> engagement in α4Y991A knock-in mice as compared to WT mice. These observations lead us to examine the role of α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>1</sub> specific integrin in pulmonary fibrosis and M2 macrophage differentiation in a setting of bleomycin induced pulmonary injury. To determine this α4Y991A k/in mice were instilled intratracheally with 3 U/Kg of bleomycin intratracheally and subsequently examined for fibrosis and macrophage differentiation on day 28. It is reported that mice homozygous for α4 integrin mutation [α4(Y991A)] are deficient in paxillin binding and manifest a profound deficit in the recruitment of mononuclear leukocytes to an inflammatory site with no defect in neutrophil recruitment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0182851.ref028">28</xref>]. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182851.g005">Fig 5A</xref> summarizes the whole lung hydroxyproline levels detected on day 28 after bleomycin challenge.

More importantly, hydroxyproline levels were significantly lower in bleomycin instilled α4Y991A k/in lungs compared with WT bleo group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182851.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). Sirius red staining in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182851.g005">Fig 5B</xref> shows that WT and α4Y991A k/in saline group did not differ histologically. In contrast, a comparison of whole lung samples from bleomycin instilled WT and α4Y991A k/in mice revealed an increased extracellular deposition of collagen in WT as compared to α4Y991A k/in mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182851.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). We also observed increase in the induction of Acta 2, Cola1 and TGF beta in WT bleo group as compared to α4Y991A k/in bleomycin treated mice on day 28 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182851.g005">Fig 5C</xref>).

Based on our previous report showing that α4Y991A k/in mice are defective in M2 macrophage differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0182851.ref024">24</xref>], we next investigated if resistance of α4Y991A k/in mice to bleomycin induced lung fibrosis was associated with defects in alternative activation of M2 macrophages. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182851.g005">Fig 5D</xref> shows the RTPCR data illustrating the significant reduction in gene expression of M2 macrophage markers viz., YM1, Fizz1, CD206 and arginase in MΘs isolated from BALs of bleomycin treated α4Y991A mice on day 28. These results were further validated by Western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182851.g005">Fig 5E</xref>). Importantly, based on our previous published report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0182851.ref024">24</xref>] and the results generated in the present study we conclude that α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-dependent Rac2 activation in macrophages controls the transcription regulation of M2 macrophage differentiation in setting of bleomycin induced lung injury and pulmonary fibrosis.</p>

<title>Macrophage autonomous, M2 dependent nature of Rac2 defect in promotion of bleomycin induced pulmonary fibrosis</title>
<p>Since Rac2 is expressed in a number of hematopoietic lineages and in endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0182851.ref035">35</xref>], we sought to determine if the pulmonary fibrosis defect noted in the Rac2-/- mouse model could be ascribed to a macrophage autonomous M2 dependent phenomenon. If so, we would predict that the injection of WT M2 macrophages and not WT M1 macrophages into Rac2-/- mice would restore the bleomycin induced pulmonary fibrosis susceptibility and rescue the lung fibrosis defect observed in the Rac2-/- model <italic>in vivo</italic>. This experiment would provide evidence that the profibrotic defect in the Rac2-/- mouse model is mechanistically linked to the M1-M2 transition defect in the macrophage lineage. Previously, we reported this methodology to determine whether a defect in Rac2 was macrophage autonomous and M2 dependent in the setting of metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0182851.ref024">24</xref>]. M1 and M2 macrophages were generated by stimulating bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) by LPS and IL4 respectively and were tested for specific gene expression before injections (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0182851.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). As predicted, the injection of WT M2 BMDMs and not WT M1 BMDMs increased fibrosis after lung injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182851.g006">Fig 6</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182851.g006">Fig 6A</xref> shows the whole lung hydroxyproline levels detected on day 28 after bleomycin challenge. Whole lung samples from bleomycin treated WT mice exhibited similar hydroxyproline levels to those observed in Rac2-/- bleomycin mice treated with M2 macrophages. More importantly, hydroxyproline levels were similar in bleomycin instilled Rac2-/- lungs compared Rac2-/- bleo mice treated with M1 macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182851.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). Sirius red staining demonstrated that Rac2-/- bleomycin treated mice had similar lung architecture as the Rac2-/- bleomycin treated mice injected with M1 macrophages. Rac2-/- bleomycin treated mice injected with M2 macrophages on the other hand, showed extensive collagen deposition, disruption of lung architecture as observed in WT bleomycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182851.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). Consistent with histopathology, the expression of fibrosis markers is significantly reduced in the Rac2-/- bleomycin treated and mice injected with M1 macrophages as compared to WT bleomycin treated animals. In contrast, the Rac2-/- bleomycin treated mice injected with M2 macrophages demonstrated an upregulation of all the fibrosis genes as compared to Rac2-/- bleomycin treated mice treated with injection of M1 MΘs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182851.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). Moreover, the injection of M2 macrophages resulted in an increased alternative activation of M2 macrophages as demonstrated by expression of YM1, Fizz1, CD206 and arginase in macrophages isolated from BALs as compared to Rac2-/- bleomycin treated and the Rac2-/- bleomycin treated mice injected with M1 macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182851.g006">Fig 6D</xref>). Notably, the expression of YM1 and CD206 is similar to the WT bleomycin treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182851.g006">Fig 6D</xref>). Similar to this, Western blot analysis also showed higher expression of M2 proteins in Rac2-/- bleomycin mice challenged with M2 macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182851.g006">Fig 6E</xref>). Taken together, these results demonstrate that the injection of WT M2 macrophages is necessary and sufficient to reverse the bleomycin induced pulmonary fibrosis defect in Rac2-/-. The results strongly demonstrate that the process is macrophage autonomous and the data suggest that it is likely to be dependent on some component of the regulation of the pro-fibrotic M2 macrophage transcriptome within the lung microenvironment.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Rac2 is a ras-related guanosine triphosphatase expressed mainly in hematopoietic cells, and is a crucial molecule regulating a diversity of endothelial cell integrin and immunoreceptor signaling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0182851.ref022">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0182851.ref024">24</xref>]. Previous studies have shown that disruption of the gene encoding Rac2 ameliorated bleomycin induced lung injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0182851.ref027">27</xref>] and significantly attenuated lung inflammation and injury in an immune complex-mediated acute lung injury model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0182851.ref013">13</xref>]. However, these studies did not describe protection from fibrosis in the Rac2-/- mice or identify the mechanism mediating the Rac2-dependent injury or fibrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0182851.ref027">27</xref>]. In the present study, we demonstrated that α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>1</sub> integrin in macrophages upstream of hematopoietic GTPase Rac2 regulates bleomycin induced fibrosis and M2 macrophage differentiation. Using a murine model of experimental pulmonary fibrosis, we demonstrated that the presence of Rac2, specifically in the macrophages, promotes increased lung injury and collagen deposition. The expression of Rac2 in macrophages skews these cells toward a profibrotic alternatively activated phenotype.</p>
<p>It is well documented that changes in the extracellular matrix (ECM) promote important biological events including inflammation, fibrosis, wound healing, tumor progression and metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0182851.ref036">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0182851.ref039">39</xref>]. The present study began with our initial observation that the provisional integrins, α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>1</sub>/α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> induced migration requires a specific isoform of Rac, Rac2, in macrophages and that this pathway regulated the tumor metastasis and alternative activation of M2 macrophages <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0182851.ref024">24</xref>]. The α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>1</sub>/α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> integrins are expressed in hematopoietic and endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0182851.ref040">40</xref>] and play a key role in inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0182851.ref041">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0182851.ref044">44</xref>]. The entry of inflammatory cells and activated fibroblasts into the injured lung depends on the ability of these cell types to interact with components of the ECM, comprised primarily of MMP-digested collagen and fibronectin, the ligands for α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> and α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>1</sub>, respectively. A study by Wang et al has shown that integrin α4 may play an important role in bleomycin induced pulmonary fibrosis, and the use of anti-α4 antibody offers therapeutic antifibrotic potential <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0182851.ref039">39</xref>]. The authors have investigated the possible role of the α4 integrin in the pathogenesis of fibrosis by administering an anti-α4 integrin antibody to mice with bleomycin induced lung fibrosis. However, these studies fail to provide a comprehensive picture for how the α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>1</sub> integrin signals to regulate M2 differentiation and pulmonary fibrosis. Our data demonstrate that α4Y991A k/in mice are defective in bleomycin induced lung injury and collagen deposition. These results are correlated with an impairment in alternative activation of M2 macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182851.g005">Fig 5</xref>). Our previous studies have defined a requirement for Rac2 in α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>1</sub> dependent migration and M2 macrophage differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0182851.ref024">24</xref>]. These data support our hypothesis that the lung fibrosis defect observed in the α4Y991A k/in model is mediated by lack of Rac2 activation downstream of the α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>1</sub> integrin.</p>
<p>In agreement with a recent study implicating Rac2 in bleomycin induced fibrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0182851.ref027">27</xref>], our pulmonary physiology results indicate that late fibrotic lung injury is attenuated in Rac2-/- mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0182851.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). We did not observe any differences in lung injury and cellular infiltration at day 3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0182851.s002">S2 Fig</xref>), but consistent with the prior report we observed a decrease in infiltration of neutrophils and BAL albumin in the bleomycin challenged Rac2-/- mice at day 7, suggesting a prominent role for Rac2 in transition from early to later phases of bleomycin induced lung injury. We also did not see differences in collagen expression at day 7, but saw increasing collagen expression in WT vs. Rac2-/- mice in the later, fibroproliferative phase. Interestingly, adoptive transfer of M2, but not M1 macrophages in the transition period (day 5) is sufficient to restore the fibrotic response to WT levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182851.g007">Fig 7</xref>). Our observations differ from those of the previous report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0182851.ref027">27</xref>] in that: 1) we did not observe mortality in WT mice up to day 28, 2) our Sirius red staining, αSMA staining and hydroxyproline content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182851.g001">Fig 1</xref>) clearly demonstrate a fibrosis defect in Rac2-/- mice at day 28 while the previous report did not report significant differences between WT and Rac2-/- groups at day 21; and 3) we observed a significant increase in TGFβ mRNA in WT samples compared to Rac2-/- after bleomycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182851.g001">Fig 1C</xref>), whereas the prior study showed no qualitative differences in TGFβ immunostaining. The studies use different doses of bleomycin, and slightly different time points and biological measures. As in our study, the authors did not observe any difference in macrophage and lymphocyte numbers in early stages following lung injury in Rac2-/- mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0182851.ref027">27</xref>]. However, the previous study did not assess macrophage polarization. The defect in infiltration of neutrophils in Rac2-/- mice at day 7 could be an important component in the progression of disease from early to later stages of bleomycin induced lung injury, but the inability of Rac2-/- to promote alternative activation of macrophages in the setting of bleomycin induced injury is a novel and important element of this report. The finding that adoptive transfer of M2, but not M1 macrophages in this time frame is sufficient to restore progression to fibrosis suggests that M2 macrophage polarization, rather than neutrophilic infiltration and vascular leak, is a more important driver of later fibrosis and pulmonary pathology.</p>
<p>Similar to the previous report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0182851.ref027">27</xref>] we found elevated MMP9 levels in macrophages isolated from WT bleomycin mice compared to Rac2-/- bleomycin samples (data not shown). In our study, we observed no disruption of lung architecture on day 3 and day 7 of bleomycin challenge in both WT and Rac2-/- mice, however there is massive infiltration of leukocytes observed on day 7 in both genotypes. Interestingly, we observed increase in expression of inflammatory M1 macrophages in both genotypes on day 3 and day 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182851.g003">Fig 3B</xref>), with increase in M2 macrophage phenotype in bleomycin challenged WT mice on day 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182851.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). Most notably, we found a defect in alternative activation of M2 macrophages in Rac2-/- mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182851.g002">Fig 2</xref>) in the late phase of lung injury on day 28. M2 macrophages have been implicated in the pathophysiology of bleomycin-induced injury in murine models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0182851.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0182851.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0182851.ref020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0182851.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0182851.ref045">45</xref>]. Our previous microarray and genomic studies conducted on BMDMs isolated from Rac2-/- mice provide evidence that Rac2 controls expression of genes related to M2 macrophage differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0182851.ref024">24</xref>].</p>
<p>Our studies suggest that Rac2 provides the signaling specificity to drive the M2 macrophage phenotype under conditions of inflammation where macrophages are interacting with the provisional extracellular matrix and this pathway is required for the development of lung fibrosis. Our data indicate that expression of Rac2 skews lung macrophages toward an alternatively activated profibrotic phenotype, which promotes collagen production, leading to the progression of experimental pulmonary fibrosis. Moreover, we found a significant increase in the expression of CD206 and CD163, typical M2 macrophage markers in human IPF patient samples, suggesting that the study conducted on our mouse model may parallel certain pathophysiologic processes involved in IPF. In conclusion, our findings identify a novel signaling axis which is necessary and sufficient for the control of pro-fibrogenic macrophage differentiation and pulmonary fibrosis <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
