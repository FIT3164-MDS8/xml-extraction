          <p>Inhibition of early platelet adhesion by blockade of glycoprotein-IB (GPIb)
                        protects mice from ischemic stroke. To elucidate underlying mechanisms
                        in-vivo, infarct development was followed by ultra-high field MRI at 17.6
                        Tesla.</p>

                        (N = 10). To control for the effect of reperfusion,
                        additional mice underwent permanent occlusion and received
                            <italic>anti-GPIb</italic> treatment (N = 6;

                        measured cerebral-blood-flow (CBF) by continuous arterial-spin labelling,
                        the apparent-diffusion-coefficient (ADC), quantitative-T2 and T2-weighted
                        imaging. All images were registered to a standard mouse brain MRI atlas and
                        statistically analysed voxel-wise, and by cortico-subcortical ROI
                        analysis.</p>

          <p>Blockade of platelet adhesion by <italic>anti-GPIb</italic>-Fab-fragments
                        results in substantially improved CBF early during reperfusion. This finding

                        infarction and indicates in-vivo an increased patency of the
                        microcirculation. Thus, progression of infarction during early ischemia and
                        reperfusion can be mitigated by anti-platelet treatment.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Ischemic stroke is a major cause of death and disability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018386-Murray1">[1]</xref>. A significant proportion of
                strokes are caused by thromboembolic occlusion of major intracerebral vessels such
                as the middle cerebral artery (MCA). The complex cellular and molecular processes
                underlying the development of ischemic brain lesions are incompletely understood
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018386-Dirnagl1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018386-Stoll1">[3]</xref>. This also
                applies to the situations in which extended and clinically severe strokes evolve
                despite “favorable” removal of the vessel occluding clot either
                spontaneously or by thrombolysis giving rise to reperfusion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018386-Coutts1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018386-Davis1">[5]</xref>. Reperfusion is a prerequisite
                for replenishing brain areas at risk for infarction with oxygen and nutritional
                factors, but, on the other hand, elicits detrimental processes referred to as
                    <italic>reperfusion injury</italic>. We could recently show that interference
                with critical steps of platelet tethering to the vessel wall can prevent ischemic
                stroke in the mouse model of transient MCA occlusion
                    (<bold><underline>t</underline></bold>MCAO) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018386-Kleinschnitz1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018386-Kleinschnitz2">[7]</xref>.The initial tethering of
                platelets at sites of vascular injury is mediated by GPIb-V-IX, a structurally
                unique receptor complex exclusively expressed in platelets and megakaryocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018386-VargaSzabo1">[8]</xref>. GPIbα
                is indispensable for platelet adhesion under conditions of high shear such as in the
                arterial cerebrovascular system. Inhibition of the von Willebrand factor
                (vWF)-binding site of GPIbα with Fab fragments of the antibody p0p/B in
                wild-type mice abrogated platelet tethering and adhesion in a model of mechanically
                induced arterial thrombosis as well as in ischemic stroke, while unspecific Fab
                fragments had no effect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018386-Kleinschnitz2">[7]</xref>. Cerebral infarcts were significantly smaller when
                assessed histologically or by 1.5T MRI. These findings make GPIb an attractive
                target for clinical development of an antithrombotic drug in acute stroke.</p>
      <p>There is recent evidence that GPIb, so far mainly regarded as instrumental in
                haemostasis and thrombus formation, can profoundly guide inflammation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018386-Petri1">[9]</xref>. Thus, the effect
                of GPIb blockade in cerebral ischemia could be due to sustained patency of blood
                vessels during reperfusion or, alternatively, due to a primary anti-inflammatory
                effect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018386-Stoll2">[10]</xref>. To
                address this important issue, we employed multimodal MRI at ultra-high-field

        <p>An additional group of <italic>anti</italic>-GP1b treated mice was investigated
                    at an even earlier time point after tMCAO, i.e. 1 h after thread removal, to
                    address the question whether the observed hypoperfusion at 2 h is preceded by
                    hyperperfusion. In this scenario, a deleterious effect of reperfusion on tissue
                    fate (reperfusion injury) might be functional rather than a beneficial effect of

        <p>Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) was performed with a pulsed-field gradient
                    Setjskal-Tanner-like multislice spin echo sequence because echo-planar-imaging

                    strength. Diffusion sensitization was only performed along the slice direction
                    to keep the overall acquisition time low <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018386-Setjskal1">[22]</xref>. Images with different
                    b-values, 0 and 800 s/mm<sup>2</sup>, were acquired to allow for the calculation
                    of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps of brain water. Whole brain
                    coverage was achieved by thirteen coronal slices acquired with a matrix size of

                    experiments (number of repetition NR = 3) led to an overall
                    acquisition time for diffusion weighted experiments of 8 min. ADC maps were

                        (SI<sub>B800</sub>/SI<sub>B0</sub>). The b value of 800 s/mm<sup>2</sup> was
                    chosen to maintain a high signal-to-noise ratio for each acquisition, in case
                    motion artifacts of the spin echo DWI sequence would degrade other
                    acquisitions.</p>
        <p>T2 relaxometric mapping was performed for the in-vivo delineation of infarcted

                    thirty two echoes at TR/TE = 4.2/2000 ms. T2 relaxation
                    times constants were calculated voxel-wise by fitting the intensities of the 20
                    first echoes to a monoexponential model. CBF, T1 and T2 relaxometric maps were

                                exhibited significant progression of hypoperfusion from 2 h to 24 h.
                                In the cortex of the MCA territory, reperfusion significantly

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>This UHF-MRI study confirms and extends our previous observation that blockade of
                platelet tethering in experimental cerebral ischemia prevents infarct growth.
                Importantly, for the first time we show in-vivo that interfering with platelet
                function can prevent naturally occurring blood flow reductions in the brain during
                reperfusion. Thus, platelets are important mediators of infarct progression during
                ischemia and reperfusion.</p>
      <p>GPIb-V-IX is a structurally unique receptor complex exclusively expressed in
                platelets and megakaryocytes which mediates the initial tethering of platelets at
                sites of vascular injury <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018386-VargaSzabo1">[8]</xref>. Blockade of GPIb ameliorates infarct growth in cerebral
                ischemia as shown previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018386-Kleinschnitz2">[7]</xref>, and confirmed here, but the underlying mechanisms are
                largely unknown. Tethering of platelets to the endothelial layer of the vessel wall
                via GPIb/vWF binding is an important initiator of thrombus formation under high
                shear conditions such as in the arterial system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018386-Stoll1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018386-Kleinschnitz1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018386-VargaSzabo1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018386-DeMeyer1">[27]</xref>. On the other hand, blockade
                of GPIb can prevent immune cell recruitment in the context of inflammation as shown
                recently in a model of experimental peritonitis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018386-Petri1">[9]</xref>. Since inflammation is more and
                more recognized as a critical component in the pathophysiology of stroke <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018386-Denes1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018386-Stoll3">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018386-Stoll4">[30]</xref>, it was
                conceivable that the beneficial effects of GPIb blockade on infarction are not
                related to improving blood flow, but rather to ameliorating secondary
                inflammation.</p>
      <p>To address this important issue we employed multimodal UHF-MRI at 17.6T in mice with
                stroke allowing the measurement of cerebral blood flow in-vivo over time, through
                the intact skull and with extended anatomical sampling both of deeply located brain
                regions and the cortex. In addition, impending infarction was assessed by the
                measurement of hypoxic diffusion restriction of free water (ADC) and quantitative T2
                was evaluated as a marker for vasogenic edema paralleling completed tissue
                infarction. All measures were acquired with high spatial resolution and extended
                coverage to achieve segmentation of the mouse cortex from subcortical structures.
                These brain regions show differences in their susceptibility to ischemia since the
                neocortex has a larger capacity for collateral blood supply. Data postprocessing and
                analysis included registration of all outcome measures into one anatomical standard
                space to enable voxel-wise statistical comparisons on group level and the
                calculation of probability maps of infarction for each group.</p>
      <p>By means of calculating probability maps of infarction for each group, we could show
                that <italic>anti-GPIb</italic> treatment protects the cerebral cortex downstream of
                the recanalized MCA from infarction. There was a significantly lower probability of
                completed infarction in this region for <italic>anti-GPIb</italic> treated mice as
                compared to controls at 24 h after <bold><underline>t</underline></bold>MCAO
                (35% vs. 95% in controls, p = 0.0001). CBF
                measurements revealed that this was due to sustained reperfusion after
                    <italic>anti-GPIb</italic> treatment. Treated mice showed a higher CBF already
                very early during reperfusion (at 1 h and 2 h after
                    <bold><underline>t</underline></bold>MCAO) as compared to controls (subcortex:
                45.3±5.9 vs. 33.6±4.3; cortex: 44.2±6.9 vs. 40.9±4.4)
                and this difference further increased with time (subcortex at 24 h: 46.9±7.5
                vs. 24.8±3.2; cortex at 24 h: 60.5±8.4 vs 26.0±3.2). Sustained
                reperfusion was also observed in the basal ganglia, which, although to a lesser
                degree than the cortex, were also protected from infarction in comparison with
                controls. The fact that infarct protection was lost after permanent MCAO clearly
                indicates that recanalization of large proximal vessels is compulsory for the
                efficacy of anti-GPIb Fab fragments. The exact mode of anti-GPIb Fab action in the
                context of brain ischemia/reperfusion injury still has to be established but reduced
                thrombus formation or destabilisation of previously formed thrombi leading to
                improved clot “washout” from the cerebral microvasculature might be
                involved <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018386-Pham1">[15]</xref>. Since
                GPIb-V-IX is a receptor complex exclusively expressed in platelets and
                megakaryocytes, the stroke-mitigating effect by anti-GPIb Fab can only be explained
                by an anti-platelet effect, and not by direct neuroprotection that could secondarily
                improve blood flow.</p>
      <p>As an additional exploratory finding, we observed a T2 increase already 2 h after
                tMCAO in control mice. This probably indicates very early vasogenic edema detectable
                only at ultra-high magnetic field strengths and is in accordance with measurements
                at 9.4 Tesla <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018386-Barber1">[31]</xref>,
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018386-Kaur1">[32]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Taken together, our study shows that preventing platelet activation can prevent
                deterioration of blood flow during the reperfusion phase after transient cerebral
                ischemia. Using multimodal in-vivo MRI at ultra-high magnetic field strength, wefor
                the first time could verify increased microvascular patency early during reperfusion
                in the wake of anti-GP1b treatment which is supported by previous histological data
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018386-DeMeyer2">[33]</xref>. These
                results further support the concept that platelets play an important role in
                mediating infarct progression during early ischemia and successive reperfusion.
                Thus, GPIb, and its downstream signalling pathways via phospholipase D1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018386-Elvers1">[34]</xref> may be
                promising new targets to combat acute ischemic stroke in the future.</p>
