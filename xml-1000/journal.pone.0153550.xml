<abstract>
<p>Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) represent an important cellular subset within the glioblastoma (WHO grade IV) microenvironment and are a potential therapeutic target. TAMs display a continuum of different polarization states between antitumorigenic M1 and protumorigenic M2 phenotypes, with a lower M1/M2 ratio correlating with worse prognosis. Here, we investigated the effect of macrophage polarization on anti-CD47 antibody-mediated phagocytosis of human glioblastoma cells <italic>in vitro</italic>, as well as the effect of anti-CD47 on the distribution of M1 versus M2 macrophages within human glioblastoma cells grown in mouse xenografts. Bone marrow-derived mouse macrophages and peripheral blood-derived human macrophages were polarized <italic>in vitro</italic> toward M1 or M2 phenotypes and verified by flow cytometry. Primary human glioblastoma cell lines were offered as targets to mouse and human M1 or M2 polarized macrophages <italic>in vitro</italic>. The addition of an anti-CD47 monoclonal antibody led to enhanced tumor-cell phagocytosis by mouse and human M1 and M2 macrophages. In both cases, the anti-CD47-induced phagocytosis by M1 was more prominent than that for M2. Dissected tumors from human glioblastoma xenografted within NOD.Cg-<italic>Prkdc</italic><sup><italic>scid</italic></sup> <italic>Il2rg</italic><sup><italic>tm1Wjl</italic></sup>/SzJ mice and treated with anti-CD47 showed a significant increase of M1 macrophages within the tumor. These data show that anti-CD47 treatment leads to enhanced tumor cell phagocytosis by both M1 and M2 macrophage subtypes with a higher phagocytosis rate by M1 macrophages. Furthermore, these data demonstrate that anti-CD47 treatment alone can shift the phenotype of macrophages toward the M1 subtype <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Glioblastoma (GBM, WHO grade IV) is the most aggressive and common malignant primary brain tumor in adults. The current standard of care of radiotherapy plus concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide can increase survival, but median survival continues to be 15–16 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153550.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153550.ref003">3</xref>]. Novel therapeutics remain elusive despite an improved understanding of the GBM microenvironment.</p>
<p>Macrophages have demonstrated promising anti-tumor potential given their inherent ability to phagocytose damaged cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153550.ref004">4</xref>]. The human body’s natural immune response is thought to have the means to selectively and effectively target GBM, and the development of immunotherapies against GBM using dendritic cells, T cells, or natural killer cells are currently underway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153550.ref005">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153550.ref007">7</xref>]. However, macrophages and microglia (tumor-associated macrophages/microglia, TAMs), which can comprise up to 30% of the bulk of tumors, are the dominant immune cells within many malignancies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153550.ref008">8</xref>]. Thus, TAMs are an intriguing immune cell target for treatment in malignant gliomas.</p>
<p>Macrophage response to foreign pathogens and biological insults is known to be heterogeneous, and a continuum of activation patterns between pro-inflammatory/classic (M1) and anti-inflammatory/alternatively activated (M2) macrophages exists. M1 macrophages facilitate the removal of bacteria and damaged cells and have been shown to have anti-tumorigenic properties, while M2 macrophages promote tissue repair and tumor proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153550.ref009">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153550.ref012">12</xref>]. Both subtypes are known to coexist within the glioma microenvironment. Generally, an increased presence of M1 TAMs correlates with lower grade glioma, while a higher M2 presence associates with increased glioma growth and decreased glioma patient survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153550.ref013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153550.ref017">17</xref>]. These and other data suggest that the M1 macrophages counter tumor growth, whereas M2 macrophages support/promote tumor growth. Thus, targeted immune-modulation to incorporate or amplify M1 macrophage activity and/or reduce M2 activity in GBM may improve outcomes.</p>
<p>Recently, CD47 has been identified as a “don’t eat me” signal on tumor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153550.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153550.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153550.ref019">19</xref>]. CD47 expression on tumor cell membranes and subsequent binding to signal-regulatory protein alpha (SIRPα) on macrophages lead to a signal cascade within the macrophages that inhibits macrophage-mediated tumor cell phagocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153550.ref020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153550.ref021">21</xref>]. Recent findings by Bhoukari et al. implicate additionally a tumor-suppressor protein deregulation in astrocytoma cell lines when CD47 is overexpressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153550.ref022">22</xref>] which sheds light on a possible tumor-propagating epigenetic mechanism of CD47 overexpression. Disruption of the CD47-SIRPα axis by monoclonal antibodies results in enhanced phagocytosis of both solid and hematopoietic tumor cells, including increased phagocytosis of GBM cells <italic>in vitro</italic> and significant anti-tumor activity <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153550.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153550.ref023">23</xref>]. Furthermore Willingham et al. have shown that anti-CD47 blockade is capable of re-educating TAMs from a tumor-promoting role to an anti-tumor one by inducing TAMs, isolated from breast, bladder, and liver cancer xenografts, to phagocytose tumor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153550.ref019">19</xref>]. The nature of the macrophages with respect to M1 versus M2 in these xenografted tumors were not determined in the previous study. Furthermore, to what extent M1 versus M2 macrophage polarization affects phagocytosis of tumor cells in the setting of anti-CD47 treatment has yet to be evaluated. Here we quantify the rate of phagocytosis for M1 and M2 macrophages <italic>in vitro</italic> and observe a larger increase in the phagocytosis rate by M1 macrophages, relative to that by M2 macrophages, however, M2 macrophage phagocytosis of tumor cells was significantly increased by anti-CD47 treatment versus control. We also show that upon tumor cell opsonisation and/or the disruption of CD47-SIRPa interactions by blocking anti-CD47 treatment, the <italic>in vivo</italic> tumor microenvironment reflects a potentially beneficial M1-dominant profile, strongly suggesting either the re-education of M2 TAMs into M1 macrophages or the enhanced recruitment of M1 macrophages from the periphery is occurring in this setting.</p>

<title>Ethics statement</title>
<p>Human adult and pediatric brain tumor tissue samples were obtained at Stanford University Medical Center and Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital (Stanford, CA) in accordance with institutional review board protocols (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://humansubjects.stanford.edu/" xlink:type="simple">http://humansubjects.stanford.edu</ext-link>) and the administrative panel on human subjects research <bold>(IRB protocol ID 18672; IRB Number 350: Panel 3)</bold>. All patients or their next of kin gave a written informed consent for tumor biopsy collection and signed a declaration permitting the use of their biopsy specimens in scientific research. IRB deemed protocol as “exempt” since tissue was acquired through the Stanford tissue bank (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://tissuebank.stanford.edu/" xlink:type="simple">http://tissuebank.stanford.edu</ext-link>) and all patient identifying information was removed and tissue was coded for identification. All protocols for the experiments involving mice, the handling of the animals and the surgical procedures were done in accordance with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) approved the protocol number 26548 and Assurance Number A3213-01. Mice were housed in a vivarium accredited by the American Association for Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care.</p>

<p>The malignant glioma cell line D270 was generously provided by Gerry Grant (Duke University, Durham, NC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153550.ref024">24</xref>]. Pathologies of patient tumors were confirmed upon histologic analysis by board-certified neuropathologists prior to further analysis. Briefly, tumors were enzymatically dissociated at 37°C for 30 minutes with collagenase-IV (CLS-4: Worthington) and DNAse1 in a solution containing Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) with Ca<sup>2+/</sup>Mg<sup>2+</sup>, non-essential amino acids, sodium pyruvate, HEPES, glutamine and antibiotic-antimycotic (Corning Inc., Corning, NY, USA). Following mechanical trituration, cells were filtered and subjected to a 0.9 M sucrose gradient centrifugation to dispose of dead cells and myelin. Upon ACK-lysis for removal of erythrocytes (Gibco Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA), cells were washed, counted and plated in a density of 1 x 10<sup>5</sup>/ml in glioblastoma stem cell medium, consisting of 50% Neurobasal-A (Gibco Life Technologies), 50% DMEM/F12, non-essential amino acids, sodium pyruvate, sodium bicarbonate, HEPES, glutamine, antibiotic-antimycotic (Corning Inc.), 20 ng/mL human recombinant EGF, 20 ng/mL human recombinant FGF (Shenandoah Biotech, Warwick, PA, USA), heparin sulfate (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and B27-supplement without Vitamin A (Gibco Life Technologies). Cells were allowed to form spheres and were grown for 2 passages.

<title>Polarization protocol</title>
<p>To generate M0 or M2 macrophages, sorted monocytes or bone-marrow cells were treated for 7 days with either recombinant human or mouse macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF; 25 ng/mL). M2 polarization was achieved by further treatment on Days 5 and 6 with IL-4 (20 ng/mL) and IL-13 (20 ng/mL). To generate M1 macrophages, sorted monocytes or bone marrow cells were treated for 7 days with either recombinant human or mouse granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF; 5 ng/mL). M1 polarization was achieved with further treatment on Day 5 by interferon gamma (IFN-γ; 20 ng/mL) stimulation for 1 hour, followed by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 48 hours (100 ng/mL; Sigma-Aldrich).

<title>Analysis of cytokines and chemokines in macrophage culture supernatants</title>
<p>This assay was performed in the Human Immune Monitoring Center at Stanford University. Human 51-plex and Mouse 26-plex kits were purchased from Affymetrix (Santa Clara, CA, USA) and used according to the manufacturer’s recommendations with modifications as described below. Briefly, samples were mixed with antibody-linked polystyrene beads on 96-well filter-bottom plates and incubated at room temperature for 2 hours followed by overnight incubation at 4°C. Room temperature incubation steps were performed on an orbital shaker at 500–600 rpm. Plates were vacuum-filtered and washed twice with wash buffer, and then incubated with biotinylated detection antibody for 2 hours at room temperature. Samples were then filtered and washed twice as above and resuspended in streptavidin-PE. After incubation for 40 minutes at room temperature, two additional vacuum washes were performed, and the samples resuspended in reading buffer. Each sample was measured in duplicate. Plates were read using a Luminex 200 instrument with a lower bound of 100 beads per sample per cytokine.</p>

<title>Flow cytometry analysis</title>
<p>The following antibodies were used for analyses of mouse bone marrow-derived mouse macrophages and human xenografts in mice: CD11b PE-Cy7, F4/80 Alexa Fluor 700, CD80 Alexa Fluor 647, CD206 PE (BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA). Antibodies for analysis of PBMC-derived human macrophages included CD11b Alexa Fluor 647, CD14 APC-Cy7, CD80 PE-Cy7, CD163 PE (BioLegend). DAPI stain (Invitrogen, Eugene OR, USA) was added to exclude dead cells.</p>
<p>Acquisition was performed on an LSRII Fortessa flow cytometer (BD-Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and sorting was performed on a FACSAria II (BD-Biosciences). Data analysis was performed using FlowJo Version 9.6.4 (Tree Star, Ashland, OR, USA). Live singlets were gated using FSC-W/FSC-H. Gates were drawn by using Fluorescent Minus One (FMO) control tubes. Macrophages were separated from tumor cells by their expression of CD11b and CD14 for human as well as CD11b and F4/80 for mouse macrophages.</p>

<title>Therapeutic antibodies</title>
<p>Hu5F9-G4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153550.ref026">26</xref>] was constructed using CDR grafting from a mouse-anti-human CD47 antibody, clone 5F9. Since Hu5F9-G4 activity is primarily dependent on blocking the CD47-SIRP-alpha interaction, a human IgG4 scaffold was selected to minimize the recruitment of Fc-dependent effector functions such as antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP), and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). The mechanism of action does not require these functions, and their presence may increase toxicity against normal cells. Hu5F9-G4 is engineered using a human kappa and IgG4 isotype with the Ser228Pro substitution to reduce Fab arm exchange. Cetuximab (Bristol-Meyers Squibb) was purchased from the Stanford clinic.</p>

<title><italic>In vitro</italic> phagocytosis assay</title>
<p>Dissociated tumor cultures were CFSE or calcein-labeled (BioLegend) and incubated with either mouse or human macrophages in serum-free IDMEM, with or without 10 μg/mL anti-CD47 monoclonal antibody (Hu5F9, IgG4) at 37°C for 2 hours (coincubation). The tumor cell to macrophage ratio was 2:1. In some instances, tumor cells or macrophages alone were pretreated with anti-CD47 antibody for 30 min and the antibody was washed out twice.</p>
<p><italic>Preparation of tumor cells</italic>: For carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE) staining, an 8.97 μM solution of CFSE in HBSS was prepared. Cells were resuspended in 1 mL of staining solution per 1 x 10<sup>6</sup> cells and incubated for 10 minutes in a 37°C water bath. Subsequently, excessive CFSE was quenched using ice-cold HBSS. Stained cells were resuspended in serum-free Icove’s DMEM at a cell concentration of 4 x 10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml. Alternatively, tumor cells were stained with calcein. A 5.27 nM solution of calcein in HBSS was prepared. Cells were resuspended in 1 mL of staining solution per 1 x 10<sup>6</sup> cells and incubated for 10 minutes in a 37°C water bath. Subsequently, excessive calcein was quenched using ice-cold HBSS. 25 μL of tumor cell suspension (100,000 cells) per well were dispensed in an ultra low-attachment 96 well plate.</p>
<sec id="sec014">
<title>Preparation of macrophages</title>
<p>Human PBMC-derived macrophages and murine BM-derived differentially polarized macrophages were washed twice with HBSS or PBS, respectively. Cells were detached from the tissue culture plates using TrypLE and cell lifters. Cells were washed with ice-cold HBSS thrice and the cell number was adjusted to 2 x 10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL in serum-free Icove’s DMEM. 25 μL of the macrophage cell suspension (50,000 cells) were added to the tumor cells in the respective wells of the 96-well plate and incubated for 2 hours at 37°C. Technical triplicates of all conditions were prepared to compare the macrophage subtype activity from a single host towards a given tumor line. For experiments to specifically isolate the contribution of FcgR-mediated phagocytosis, tumor cells and macrophages were pre-incubated with Fc Block (BD Biosciences) containing recombinant Fc protein to block Fc receptors on macrophages to eliminate Fc mediated ADCP prior to mixing the cells for phagocytosis. Tumor cells and macrophages were pre-incubated with 10ug/ml of recombinant Fc protein for 60 minutes on ice. Cells were spun down only supernatant removed and pelleted cells prepared for phagocytosis assay as described above.</p>
<p>Staining of macrophages was done directly after the phagocytosis assays in the 96-well plates utilized for the assay. The respective antibody master mix was added directly to the wells after the phagocytosis assay was finished. The master mix additionally contained mouse IgG (1 μg per 1 x 106 cells) to block unspecific binding of antibodies to Fc-receptors of macrophages. Cells were incubated with the antibodies for 30 minutes on ice in the dark. Subsequently, cells were washed twice with FACS buffer and DAPI staining was performed to enable exclusion of dead cells from analysis. Cells were analyzed with a BD LSR Fortessa using a high throughput sampler. Gates were placed according to unstained and fluorescence-minus-one (FMO) controls. Fluorescently labeled antibodies targeting macrophage markers CD11b and CD14 (human) or CD11b and F4/80 (mouse) were used to identify the macrophage population (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0153550.s001">S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0153550.s002">S2</xref> Figs) Macrophages that had successfully phagocytized tumor cells were also positive for the CFSE or calcein stain.

<p>Early passage spheres (5<sup>th</sup> passage) of GBM4 and GBM5 were transduced with GFP and luciferase encoding lentivirus (pEF1-GFP-E2A-FLuc, System Biosciences, Mountain View, CA, USA), expanded in glioblastoma stem cell media and double sorted to obtain a 100% luciferase-expressing population. The selected population was expanded in glioma stem cells media and orthotopically injected to the site of tumor resection. In brief, 6–10-week-old mice were anesthetized with 3% isoflurane (Minrad International, Buffalo, NY, USA) in an induction chamber. Anesthesia on the stereotactic frame (David Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA, USA) was maintained at 2% isoflurane delivered through a nose adaptor. A burr hole was placed 2 mm lateral and 3 mm posterior of bregma. A blunt-ended needle (75N, 26s/2”/2, 5 μL; Hamilton Co., Reno, NV, USA) was lowered into the burr hole to a depth of 4 mm below the dura surface and retracted 1 mm to form a small reservoir. Using a microinjection pump (UMP-3; World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL, USA), 10<sup>5</sup> cells were injected in a volume of 4 μL at 35 nL/second. After leaving the needle in place for 2 minutes, it was retracted at 1 mm/min.</p>
<p>Tumor formation was followed by bioluminescence imaging on IVIS spectrum (Caliper Life Science, Hopkinton, MA, USA) and quantified with Live Image 4.0 software (Living Image, PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA). Engrafted mice, based on a region of interest photon flux rate of &gt;10<sup>5</sup>/s after 14 days (GBM4) and 35 days (GBM5), were then treated with intraperitoneal injections of PBS or 250 μg of the anti-CD47 antibody for 1 week daily (GBM4) or 30 days on alternating days (GBM5), with treatment schedule based on the xenografted mice’s time to morbidity. In the case of GBM4, n = 2 mice per group were analyzed, and n = 6 for GBM5. Mice were sacrificed and the tumor mass was dissected and dissociated for subsequent flow cytometer analysis. For survival and efficacy analysis, 1.5 x 10<sup>5</sup> GBM5 cells were orthotopically injected and treatment initiated after 35 days. Mice were monitored until endpoint.</p>

<title>Phagocytosis of GBM cells by human M1 and M2 macrophages <italic>in vitro</italic></title>
<p>We used the same <italic>in vitro</italic> assay to evaluate whether human M1 and M2 macrophage phagocytosis activities differed toward primary GBM lines. Five different primary tumor cell lines, GBM1-4 and PGBM1, were offered to either human M1 or M2 macrophages as targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153550.g002">Fig 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0153550.s005">S5B Fig</xref>).

Both M1 and M2 macrophages showed increased phagocytosis of all tumor lines evaluated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153550.g002">Fig 2</xref>). The mean phagocytosis rate of human M1 macrophages toward all tumor cells increased significantly upon anti-CD47 treatment (overall increase 47%, p = 0.015, paired t-test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153550.g002">Fig 2A and 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0153550.s005">S5B Fig</xref>).

However, in GBM2 and GBM3 where we did not see a statistically significant increase in M1 macrophage phagocytosis, we consistently observed a higher phagocytosis rate in M1 macrophages.</p>

<p>Three primary tumor lines were additionally co-cultured with unpolarized or human M0 macrophages displaying a mean phagocytosis rate of 18.3% at baseline. Anti-CD47 treatment of co-cultured human M0 macrophages with these tumor cells yielded a significantly higher mean phagocytosis rate of 46.7% (difference 28.3%, p = 0.0006, paired t-test, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0153550.s006">S6A Fig</xref>). When neural progenitor cells were offered as targets, phagocytosis by M1 or M2 subsets after anti-CD47 treatment was less than that observed towards glioblastoma (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0153550.s006">S6B and S6C Fig</xref>). This result indicates that the polarization state of macrophages does not affect the specificity of anti-CD47 against tumor cells.</p>
<p>To appreciate the effect that Fc-receptor mediated opsonization can have on coinciding Sirp-CD47 disruption on phagocytosis, we performed additional phagocytosis assays with Fc-blocked monoclonal antibodies toward GBM primary lines, thereby reducing nonspecific IgG binding. This strategy of limiting the Fc-receptor contribution continued to yield a phagocytosis rate that was significantly higher than that of IgG4-only control, however it was significantly albeit marginally decreased from that of the unblocked antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153550.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). To examine how IgG subclass may affect antibody-mediated cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) effects and CD47-Sirp disruption-induced phagocytosis, we treated glioblastoma cells with an IgG1-antibody against an unrelated target, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR, cetuximab). Unlike after Fc-receptor blockade of Hu5F9-G4, where a significant contribution of CD47-Sirp disruption towards the overall phagocytosis persisted, the ADCP-effect of Cetuximab significantly decreased upon blocking Fc receptors on macrophages. To detect the baseline antibody-mediated cellular cytotoxicity, we performed an additional comparison of tumor cells (GBM6) and macrophages (M0) pretreated with anti-CD47 or isotype-matched antibody (mouse IgG4) before coincubation. Only pretreating tumor cells with Hu5F9-G4, and not the macrophages, resulted in an increase of phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153550.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). Pretreatment of macrophages and subsequent wash-out of the antibody did not influence tumor cells phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153550.g003">Fig 3B</xref>).</p>

<p>Last, we investigated whether anti-CD47 treatment <italic>in vivo</italic> changed the macrophage polarization profile toward a favorable anti-tumorigenic microenvironment. Mice that had been orthotopically xenografted with primary brain tumor cells from a low-passage primary glioma line (GBM5) or a different, highly aggressive glioma cell line (GBM4), and confirmed by bioluminescence imaging, were subsequently treated with either anti-CD47 antibody or control for 4 weeks (1 week in case of engrafted GBM4) after tumor induction. The resulting tumor-bearing brain tissue was analyzed by FACS for its mouse macrophage surface marker profile. Mice treated with anti-CD47 monoclonal antibodies were found to have an increased number of macrophages with M1 phenotype markers relative to untreated mice (data not shown). The ratio of M1 cell counts (CD80+/total macrophage number) was significantly higher in treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153550.g004">Fig 4A</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Recently, we have shown that use of blocking anti-CD47 monoclonal antibodies and peptides are common therapeutic modalities disrupting the innate immune checkpoint by which cells prevent macrophage-mediated phagocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153550.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153550.ref023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153550.ref032">32</xref>]. Elimination of tumor cells by anti-CD47 antibodies may occur through a variety of mechanisms which include both phagocytic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153550.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153550.ref033">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153550.ref034">34</xref>] and non-phagocytic tumor cell killing by neutrophils and NK cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153550.ref035">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153550.ref036">36</xref>]. While the humanized anti-CD47 antibody (Hu5F9-G4) used in this study has been shown to block the CD47-SIRPα interaction and induce phagocytosis of leukemia cells[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153550.ref026">26</xref>] we can not rule out the possibility of Fc mediated opsonization as human macrophages express high affinity Fc receptor FcRγ1. Here, we show that M1 macrophages display a larger phagocytic response towards GBM than M2 macrophages upon tumor cell opsonization and/or CD47-SIRPα disruption <italic>in vitro</italic>. This was observed using both mouse and human macrophages, however, the phagocytic response by both species after anti-CD47 treatment varied by the targeted tumor cell line and the individual macrophage batch used per experiment. CD47-expression was high in all of the analyzed samples and CD47 expression did not positively correlate with phagocytic activity in the tested cell lines. One tumor cell line, GBM4, had a particularly high CD47 expression and displayed a lower baseline and antibody induced phagocytosis. Whether this observation can be extrapolated towards an inverse correlation between phagocytic activity and CD47 expression level remains speculative. Given that CD47 expression levels were not greatly different across most tumor lines, we believe that donor-related Sirp expression-levels may have partially contributed to the range of baseline- and induced-phagocytosis strength toward GBM samples within macrophage subtypes. Alternatively, the balancing effect of the various other “eat me” and don’t eat me” signals in an individual tumor line could contribute to this phenomenon. As another possible explanation, Sirpα-polymorphisms among the different (individual) donor macrophages could have differential levels of phagocytosis as it has been previously shown that polymorphism in SIRPα controls CD47 binding and autoimmunity[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153550.ref037">37</xref>]. It has also been shown that SIRPα polymorphisms controls phagocytosis of apoptotic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153550.ref038">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153550.ref039">39</xref>] hence we speculate that SIRPα polymorphism could function as a potential biomarker for patient selection for anti-CD47 immunotherapy.</p>
<p>Further, our <italic>in vitro</italic> data showed that mouse M2 and human M2 macrophages were also responsive to CD47-SIRPα disruption, despite this subtype’s tumorigenic growth characteristics and association with worse clinical outcomes. This circumstance might be additionally favorable for GBM patients with high proportions of M2 macrophages within their tumors, as anti-CD47 treatment promotes these macrophages towards tumor phagocytosis. Indeed Willingham et al. showed that macrophages isolated from flank breast, bladder, and liver cancer xenografts phagocytized tumor cells when co-incubated with blocking anti-CD47 antibody <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153550.ref019">19</xref>]. To measure Fc-receptor mediated opsonization effect of Hu5F9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153550.ref026">26</xref>] toward GBM, we performed additional phagocytosis assays with nonspecifically Fc-blocked Hu5F9 which consistently sustained elevated levels of GBM phagocytosis. In addition we assessed the effect of pretreatment of either macrophages or tumor cells alone before performing the phagocytosis experiments. The IgG4 isotype antibody did not induce macrophage phagocytosis compared to anti-CD47 treatment. Of note, pretreatment of tumor cells resulted in an equal phagocytosis induction as when adding the antibody directly to the macrophage-tumor cell mix, which is explained by CD47-Sirpα disruption on GBM, whereas pretreatment of macrophages alone was not correlated to higher tumor-cell phagocytosis. While complete Fc-receptor independency of the observed phenomena can not be ruled out, our use of Fc-blocked IgG4 and IgG1 monoclonal antibodies suggests a large proportion of GBM phagocytosis is driven by CD47 inhibition. As seen in here with GBM, prior studies have similarly been unable to use IgG4 isotypes to induce macrophage phagocytosis towards malignancies, reaffirming a Fab-predominant mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153550.ref026">26</xref>]. Likewise, studies performed by Burger et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153550.ref040">40</xref>] have recently shown that blocking of the CD47-Sirpα interaction by F(ab’)2 fragments was sufficient to induce erythrocyte phagocytosis. In spite of these studies, the varying expression by different tumors of Fc receptor subclasses with their varying binding affinities, along with the potentially synergistic role of Fc-related effects and Hu5F9-G4 antibody therapy, our observed increase of GBM phagocytosis may be a shared contribution of tumor cell opsonization and the disruption of CD47-SIRPα interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153550.ref041">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153550.ref042">42</xref>]. Hitherto, introduction of additional “eat me” signals in the form of Fc-receptors to promote antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity or complement-mediated cytotoxicity in addition to CD47 blockade is currently under investigation as a therapeutic strategy.</p>
<p>Our <italic>in vitro</italic> findings demonstrate for the first time the differential phagocytosis-promoting effects of CD47-SIRPα disruption on mouse and human macrophage polarization subtypes. Various studies have demonstrated the pro-phagocytic effect of anti-CD47 antibodies, albeit in unpolarized macrophages, which we found to be comparable to M2 macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153550.ref043">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153550.ref044">44</xref>]. We deciphered the inherent phagocytic potential of macrophage subtypes, isolated from the influence of any variations in microenvironment. However, our findings do not consider the effects of the surrounding cellular and cytokine milieu <italic>in vivo</italic> that may promote tumor viability or modulate other macrophage properties including variations in macrophage subtype polarization states [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153550.ref045">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153550.ref049">49</xref>]. Further, we did not find a polarization shift from M2 to M1 upon anti-CD47 treatment <italic>in vitro</italic>, which might be due to the relatively short exposure of the <italic>in vitro</italic> polarized cells to anti-CD47 treatment and lack of important tumor microenvironment constituent in the <italic>in vitro</italic> situation. Although both M1 and M2 subtypes demonstrate a robust response to CD47-SIRPα disruption, the stronger M1 antitumor response and associated cytokine profile suggest a clinical value from enhancing the M1 macrophage response toward gliomas and other solid tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153550.ref050">50</xref>].</p>
<p>Last, our <italic>in vivo</italic> data show that the macrophage population in the tumor environment is dynamic and shifts toward a pro-inflammatory immune M1 dominant response after anti-CD47 treatment. Importantly, this observation is coupled to a prolonged survival in the treated animals and a significantly reduced tumor burden. In tumors of untreated animals, most TAMs were of the M2 subtype, which is in line with previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153550.ref051">51</xref>]. Most importantly, we observed that levels of mouse M1 macrophages in the microenvironment of xenografted tumors more than doubled with anti-CD47 treatment, whereas levels of mouse M2 macrophages exhibited a less pronounced increase. Whether or not this increase is caused by an influx of new M1 cells or reflects an augmented macrophage polarization from M2 toward the M1-type remains undetermined. Moreover, the origin of these polarized TAMs remains to be defined, as it might well be that microglial cells of predominantly M2-type represent a major subpopulation within the TAM pool. One might speculate that there is a resulting reprogramming of TAMs, including microglia, toward the M1 phenotype, although it is also possible that anti-CD47 blocking antibodies provided selective environments in the tumor that favor pre-committed M1 macrophages to enter and/or proliferate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153550.ref051">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153550.ref052">52</xref>].</p>
<p>Our <italic>in vivo</italic> findings are the first to demonstrate that disruption of the CD47-SIRPα axis and/or Fc mediated tumor cell opsonization results in a more pro-inflammatory immune presence based on the higher M1 content within treated tumors. A potential mechanism for producing a subsequent, local increase in phagocytosis upon anti-CD47 treatment may include cytoskeletal mobilization induced by inhibited SIRPα signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153550.ref053">53</xref>]. Knockdown of SIRPα (and therefore mimicking CD47–SIRPα disruption) has also recently been shown to induce migration of macrophages towards tumor cells, strengthen macrophage survival and propagate a proinflammatory cytokine response via NF-κB signaling, which is consistent with an M1-phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153550.ref054">54</xref>]. Mechanistically, varying SIRPα signaling levels could therefore be responsible for the observed M1–M2 shift.</p>
<p>Anti-CD47 antibody therapy represents an alternative avenue to promote a pro-inflammatory environment that will enhance the body’s anti-tumor response. Previous efforts have sought to recreate a similar pro-inflammatory microenvironment by personalized vaccinations of irradiated tumor cells transduced with stimulatory B7-2 and GM-CSF genes or, conversely, by inhibiting M2 growth via CSF-1R inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153550.ref055">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153550.ref056">56</xref>]. However, anti-CD47 therapy provides a unique means of targeting gliomas by taking advantage of local TAMs and enhancing the M1 macrophage presence and response. The anti-tumor role of macrophages has been a growing field, whereby additional considerations to increase macrophage recruitment and infiltration will likely augment future clinical responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153550.ref050">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153550.ref057">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153550.ref058">58</xref>]. Finally, we have recently shown that activating macrophages through TLR 3,4,7 leads to a pathway resulting in augmented secretion of truncated phosphorylated calreticulin, which then serves as an “eat me” signal for macrophages guiding these macrophages toward the tumor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153550.ref059">59</xref>]; switching macrophages to the M1 phenotype should augment this, and therefore anti-CD47 <italic>in vivo</italic> anti-cancer therapies.</p>
<p>We conclude that the promotion of M1 macrophages represents an opportunity to enhance the anti-glioma effect achieved by anti-CD47 monoclonal antibodies, which also promote the classical (M1) phenotype of macrophages.</p>
