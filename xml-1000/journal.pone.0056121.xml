      <abstract>
        <p>Zta is a lytic transactivator of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and has been shown to promote migration and invasion of epithelial cells. Although previous studies indicate that Zta induces expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 9 and MMP1, direct evidence linking the MMPs to Zta-induced cell migration and invasion is still lacking. Here we performed a series of <italic>in vitro</italic> studies to re-examine the expression profile and biologic functions of Zta-induced MMPs in epithelial cells derived from nasopharyngeal carcinoma. We found that, in addition to MMP9, MMP3 was a new target gene upregulated by Zta. Ectopic Zta expression in EBV-negative cells increased both mRNA and protein production of MMP3. Endogenous Zta also contributed to induction of MMP3 expression, migration and invasion of EBV-infected cells. Zta activated the MMP3 promoter through three AP-1 elements, and its DNA-binding domain was required for the promoter binding and MMP3 induction. We further tested the effects of MMP3 and MMP9 on cell motility and invasiveness <italic>in vitro</italic>. Zta-promoted cell migration required MMP3 but not MMP9. On the other hand, both MMP3 and MMP9 were essential for Zta-induced cell invasion, and co-expression of the two MMPs synergistically increased cell invasiveness. Therefore, this study provides integrated evidence demonstrating that, at least in the <italic>in vitro</italic> cell models, Zta drives cell migration and invasion through MMPs.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a human herpesvirus which infects both lymphoid and epithelial cells and contributes to pathogenesis of several lymphomas and carcinomas. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is an epithelial cancer endemic in southern China, southeast Asia, the Arctic, and North Africa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056121-Chan1">[1]</xref>. In the endemic areas, the strong association between NPC and EBV is supported by prevalent detection of viral genomes, transcripts, and antigens in the tumor specimens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056121-RaabTraub1">[2]</xref>. Although EBV majorly adopts latent infection in NPC tumors, a small subset of the tumor cells undergo abortive lytic infection where some immediate early or early viral genes are expressed but late lytic transcripts are rarely detected <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056121-Cochet1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056121-MartelRenoir1">[5]</xref>. Some clues suggest that EBV reactivation into the lytic cycle is linked to development or progression of NPC. Elevated antibody titers in sera against EBV lytic antigens predict a high risk of NPC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056121-Chien1">[6]</xref> and are also correlated with advanced clinical stage, poor prognosis, or tumor recurrence of NPC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056121-deVathaire1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056121-Yip1">[9]</xref>. Meanwhile, some environmental or dietary factors associated with a high incidence of NPC act as not only carcinogens but also potent inducers of the viral lytic cycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056121-Bouvier1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056121-Shao1">[11]</xref>. Recent studies have also suggested that EBV reactivation and certain lytic proteins enhance genome instability of NPC cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056121-Fang1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056121-Huang1">[13]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Another link between lytic EBV infection and NPC comes from the potential contribution of a viral lytic protein Zta to NPC metastasis. Zta, also named BZLF1, is a unique member of the basic leucine-zipper (b-Zip) transcription factors and functions as an essential transactivator for the switch from EBV latency to the lytic cycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056121-Rooney1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056121-Grogan1">[15]</xref>. It forms a homodimer and binds to its target promoters through the DNA elements that are identical or similar to the binding sites for other cellular b-Zip proteins such as AP-1 or C/EBP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056121-Kouzarides1">[16]</xref>. Through the promoter binding, Zta regulates transcription of not only viral lytic genes but also some cellular genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056121-HolleyGuthrie1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056121-Chang1">[20]</xref>. Previous studies indicate that anti-Zta antibodies are increased in NPC patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056121-Joab1">[21]</xref> and the patients with higher titers of anti-Zta antibodies have a poorer clinical outcome owing to high incidence of tumor metastasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056121-Yip1">[9]</xref>. Notably, an immunohistochemical study shows that positive detection of Zta protein in tumor cells is correlated with advanced NPC metastasis to neck lymph nodes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056121-Yoshizaki1">[4]</xref>. The potential of Zta to promote metastasis is further supported by an <italic>in vitro</italic> study showing that stable Zta expression in a keratinocyte cell line enhances cell motility and invasiveness in a collagen gel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056121-Lu1">[22]</xref>.</p>
      <p>How Zta promotes cell migration and invasion is largely unknown. Two previous studies suggest that it may involve induction of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), a family of zinc-dependent proteolytic enzymes associated with multiple processes of cancer progression, including cell growth, migration, invasion, and angiogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056121-Kessenbrock1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056121-Egeblad1">[24]</xref>. Zta upregulates MMP9 in a cervical carcinoma cell line but the biologic effects of Zta-induced MMP9 on this cell line have not been tested previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056121-Yoshizaki1">[4]</xref>. On the other hand, MMP1 is induced by Zta in a keratinocyte cell line and essential for survival of the cells growing in a collagen gel, while the contribution of MMP1 to cell migration or invasion has not been shown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056121-Lu1">[22]</xref>. These two studies indicate that Zta upregulates different MMPs probably in a cell-dependent manner. However, we are not sure whether and what Zta-induced MMPs functionally contribute to cell motility or invasiveness.</p>
      <p>For two specific aims, we used a series of <italic>in vitro</italic> studies to re-examine the expression profile and biologic functions of Zta-induced MMPs in epithelial cells derived from NPC. The first aim is to test whether multiple MMPs can be co-induced by Zta in NPC cells. Since promoters of some MMP genes contain similar <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements, these MMPs are likely to be co-regulated. For example, MMP9, MMP14, and MMP15 are regulated by the Rb-E2F pathway and co-expressed in non-small cell lung cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056121-Johnson1">[25]</xref>, while MMP2 and MMP9 are co-induced by some other mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056121-Hung1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056121-Luo1">[27]</xref>. The second aim of this study is to prove that MMPs functionally contribute to Zta-induced migration and invasion of NPC cells <italic>in vitro</italic>. Since various MMPs exert distinct or overlapped functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056121-Egeblad1">[24]</xref>, we speculated that co-induction of multiple MMPs may be required for the full biologic effects of Zta. Indeed, we found that MMP3 and MMP9 were co-upregulated by Zta through a similar mechanism. Furthermore, the Zta-induced MMP3 and MMP9 differentially affected cell migration but synergistically contributed to cell invasion. Therefore, our results reveal an underlying mechanism of Zta-induced cell migration and invasion.</p>

        <title>Endogenous Zta Contributes to Induction of MMP3 Expression, Migration and Invasion of EBV-infected Cells</title>
        <p>Next we wondered whether endogenous Zta expressed in EBV-infected cells can be also involved in upregulation of MMP3. We examined an EBV-infected NPC cell line, TW01-ERGV, where doxycycline treatment drives expression of a lytic transactivator Rta, resulting in induction of endogenous Zta and its downstream lytic genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056121-Ragoczy1">[38]</xref>. After doxycycline treatment, TW01-ERGV cells expressed Rta, Zta and a downstream lytic protein EA-D/BMRF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0056121-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>), and meanwhile their production of MMP3 was also increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0056121-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). To clarify the role of endogenous Zta, we transfected the cells with Zta-targeted siRNAs, which inhibited expression of endogenous Zta and Zta-induced Rta <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056121-Chang1">[20]</xref> while did not affect expression of doxycycline-induced exogenous Rta. As expected, transfection with the Zta siRNAs completely blocked Zta expression but only partially reduced Rta expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0056121-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). Since EA-D expression is regulated by both Zta and Rta <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056121-HolleyGuthrie1">[17]</xref>, knockdown of endogenous Zta reduced half the level of EA-D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0056121-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). Notably, knockdown of endogenous Zta abolished the induction of MMP3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0056121-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>), supporting that Zta is important for regulation of MMP3 expression in the context of EBV-infected cells. We further tested the effect of endogenous Zta on cell migration and invasion. Cell motility was examined by using a transwell migration assay, and cell invasiveness in ECM was examined by using a Matrigel invasion assay. Doxycycline-induced EBV reactivation enhanced migration and invasion of TW01-ERGV cells, and both the effects were inhibited when endogenous Zta was knocked down by siRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0056121-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>). This result supports that, during lytic EBV infection, endogenous Zta is an important trigger of cell migration and invasion. Meanwhile we do not rule out the possibility that downstream lytic proteins induced by Zta may be also involved in the biologic effects.</p>

Accordingly, the MMP3 promoter constructs with various mutations at AP-1 sites were further tested. Disruption of any of the three AP-1 elements at −216, −172 and −89 profoundly impaired the responsiveness to Zta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0056121-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>), indicating that all of them are essential for the full Zta-triggered activation of the MMP3 promoter. The AP-1 site at −216 seems to be most important since single mutation at this site abolished the promoter responsiveness to Zta. Furthermore, dual or triple mutation of these three AP-1 sites also completely blocked the Zta-induced transactivation. Therefore, Zta activates the MMP3 promoter through multiple AP-1 elements.</p>

        <p>Next we examined the biologic effects of Zta-induced MMPs, testing whether MMP3 and MMP9 are involved in Zta-promoted migration and invasion of NPC cells <italic>in vitro</italic>. Compared with the vector control cells, Zta-transfected HONE-1 cells showed more migratory and invasive ability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0056121-g006">Figs. 6A to 6C</xref>). We further used siRNAs to examine the contributions of MMP3 and MMP9 in this context. Knockdown of MMP3, which did not affect MMP9 induction, significantly reduced Zta-induced cell migration and invasion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0056121-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>). On the other hand, knockdown of MMP9, which did not affect MMP3 induction, blocked cell invasion but had no effect on cell migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0056121-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>). These results suggest that Zta promotes cell migration in a MMP3-dependent, MMP9-independent manner, while Zta substantially promotes cell invasion through a mechanism requiring co-induction of MMP3 and MMP9. To confirm this hypothesis, we used specific MMP inhibitors that blocked the enzymatic activity but did not affect the protein levels of MMPs. Zta-induced cell migration was abolished by the MMP3 inhibitor but not by the MMP9 inhibitor, while Zta-induced cell invasion was blocked by either of the inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0056121-g006">Fig. 6C</xref>).

MMP3 expressed alone sufficiently promoted cell migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0056121-g007">Fig. 7</xref>).

Therefore, MMP3, not MMP9, functions as a promoter of NPC cell migration.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Extending from previous studies separately showing that Zta promotes cell migration/invasion and that Zta induces MMP expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056121-Yoshizaki1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056121-Lu1">[22]</xref>, this study provides integrated evidence demonstrating that Zta drives cell migration and invasion through induction of MMPs. Our new findings include that (1) MMP3, like MMP9 found previously, is induced by Zta; (2) MMP3 is required for Zta-induced cell migration but MMP9 is not; (3) both MMP3 and MMP9 contribute to Zta-induced cell invasion. Although these findings are based on <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments and we have not examined biopsy specimens, this study reveals a possible mechanism how Zta increases cell motility and invasiveness. It remains to be studied whether this mechanism is linked to a previous report showing that Zta expression correlates with neck metastasis of NPC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056121-Yoshizaki1">[4]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Compared with a previous study about Zta-mediated induction of MMP9 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056121-Yoshizaki1">[4]</xref>, our present study indicates that Zta can also induce MMP3 expression and the induction mechanism is similar to that of MMP9. Both MMP3 and MMP9 are upregulated by Zta at a transcriptional level, and Zta activates the promoters of both MMPs through AP-1 elements. In addition, Zta binds to both promoters, and the DNA-binding domain of Zta is required for induction of both MMPs. Notably, all three AP-1 sites in the MMP3 promoter are essential for the responsiveness to Zta, suggesting that Zta needs multiple binding elements for the full transactivation. The MMP9 promoter also contains three AP-1 sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056121-Lan1">[36]</xref>, but so far only one of them has been tested for Zta-mediated transactivation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056121-Yoshizaki1">[4]</xref>. Multiple Zta-binding DNA elements are also found in the promoters of other Zta-regulated genes, including interleukin (IL)-10 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056121-Mahot1">[19]</xref>, IL-8 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056121-Hsu1">[18]</xref>, and early growth response-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056121-Chang1">[20]</xref>. It is likely that cooperative interaction among adjacently DNA-bound Zta is important for transactivation of these promoters. A similar case is JunB, a member of AP-1 family proteins, which can activate the promoter containing multimeric AP-1 elements but not the promoter with only a single AP-1 site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056121-Chiu1">[39]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In addition to direct targeting of Zta to the promoters of MMP3 and MMP9, other mechanisms may also be involved in Zta-mediated induction of the MMPs. First, Zta may induce expression of other transcription factors to indirectly regulate the MMP promoters. For example, Zta has been previously shown to upregulate c-Fos and early growth response-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056121-Chang1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056121-Flemington2">[40]</xref>, two cellular transcription factors associated with induction of MMP3 and MMP9 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056121-Fauquier1">[41]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056121-Shin1">[43]</xref>. Zta may also affect some cellular signaling pathways to regulate MMP expression. It has been reported that Zta can trigger activation of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056121-Chang1">[20]</xref>, which may be critical for induction of various MMPs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056121-Luo1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056121-Lan1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056121-Chung1">[44]</xref>. Alternatively, MMP expression may be modulated by some Zta-induced secreted factors in an autocrine or paracrine manner. IL-8 and prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub>, two secreted factors that can be augmented by Zta <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056121-Hsu1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056121-Lee1">[37]</xref>, have been shown to upregulate MMP3 and MMP9 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056121-Inoue1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056121-Bu1">[46]</xref>. Besides, our unpublished data indicated that Zta can induce heparin-binding epidermal growth factor, which is another secreted factor potentially linked to induction of both MMPs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056121-Ongusaha1">[47]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Considering that many promoters of MMP genes contain similar <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements, multiple MMPs can be co-regulated by some common inducers or mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056121-Ongusaha1">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056121-Belguise1">[48]</xref>. However, according to our MMP array analysis, only MMP3 and MMP9 can be prominently upregulated by Zta. Although the promoters of MMP1 and MMP10 genes contain AP-1 elements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056121-Chakraborti1">[49]</xref>, Zta does not induce these two MMPs in our study, in contrast to a previous study showing Zta-induced MMP1 expression in a keratinocyte cell line <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056121-Lu1">[22]</xref>. Therefore, in addition to existence of AP-1 elements in the MMP promoters, there must be other cell-specific requirements determining MMP induction by Zta. One possibility is the DNA methylation status of MMP promoters, as Zta preferentially binds to and activates methylated promoters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056121-Dickerson1">[50]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056121-Bhende1">[51]</xref>. In line with this notion, methylation status of MMP promoters has been reported to be cell-specific, and the epigenetic status affects MMP expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056121-Couillard1">[52]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056121-Chicoine1">[53]</xref>. On the other hand, AP-1 proteins may cooperate with different cofactors for regulation of individual MMP genes. For example, AP-1-mediated induction of MMP1 requires ETS1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056121-Westermarck1">[54]</xref> while the induction of MMP9 depends on cooperation with STAT3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056121-Song1">[55]</xref>. Being an AP-1-like b-Zip transcription factor, Zta may also interact with some cell-specific cofactors that result in the differential MMP induction by Zta.</p>
      <p>Co-expression of multiple MMPs has been detected in tumor tissues and associated with cancer progression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056121-Saez1">[56]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056121-Mendes1">[57]</xref>. However, it remains unclear whether the co-expressed MMPs exert independent, redundant, or synergistic effects on cancer progression. In this study, MMP3 and MMP9 differentially affect cell migration. Blocking or overexpression of MMP9 did not influence cell migration, indicating that MMP9 has minimal effect on cell migration. By contrast, knockdown or inhibition of MMP3 blocked Zta-induced cell migration and ectopic expression of MMP3 alone sufficiently increased cell motility, indicating that MMP3 plays a critical role therein. MMP3 may promote cell migration in several ways. For example, MMP3 may cleave E-cadherin to facilitate cell disassociation, increase cell motility, and trigger epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056121-Lochter1">[58]</xref>. MMP3 may also induce production of keratinocyte growth factor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056121-Lochter1">[58]</xref>, a secreted protein associated with enhanced cell migration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056121-Zang1">[59]</xref>. Further studies are required to identify the mechanisms how Zta-induced MMP3 promotes cell migration.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, this study indicates that Zta-induced MMP3 and MMP9 synergistically drive cell invasion. MMP9 is a well-documented MMP that digests ECM and facilitates cell invasion. Interestingly, our study indicates that MMP3 also essentially contributes to cell invasiveness in the presence of MMP9. Knockdown or inhibition of MMP3 suppressed Zta-induced cell invasiveness in ECM. In addition, although ectopic expression of MMP3 alone barely influenced cell invasion, it significantly increased cell invasiveness when MMP9 was co-expressed. The synergy of MMP3 and MMP9 may be explained by several potential mechanisms. First, our data show that Zta-induced MMP3 promotes cell migration, which may be critical and prerequisite for subsequent MMP9-induced cell invasion. Second, MMP3 can be an upstream activator of other MMPs including MMP9 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056121-Chakraborti1">[49]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056121-Lochter1">[58]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056121-Ogata1">[60]</xref>, so MMP3 may enhance enzymatic activity of MMP9 to promote invasion. Meanwhile, cell invasion can be augmented when MMP9 is recruited by CD44 to the invasive front of cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056121-Egeblad1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056121-Yu1">[61]</xref>. Considering that MMP3 can induces keratinocyte growth factor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056121-Lochter1">[58]</xref>, which upregulates CD44 expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056121-Karvinen1">[62]</xref>, thus MMP3 may indirectly facilitate surface recruitment of MMP9 to promote cell invasion.</p>
      <p>Through MMP3 and MMP9, Zta may regulate other pathogenic effects in addition to cell migration and invasion. Based on the broad substrates of MMP3 and MMP9, their potential effects may be involved in multiple steps of cancer progression, including cell survival, proliferation, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, migration, angiogenesis, immunosuppression, and metastasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056121-Egeblad1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056121-Sheu1">[63]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056121-Bergers1">[64]</xref>. Notably, MMP3 and/or MMP9 can also be upregulated by other EBV proteins, such as latent membrane protein-1 and -2A <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056121-Lan1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056121-Lee2">[65]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056121-Yoshizaki2">[66]</xref>. It is likely that EBV has evolved multiple ways for induction of MMPs, probably explaining the prevalent detection of MMPs in NPC tumor tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056121-Lu1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056121-Lee2">[65]</xref>. Thus EBV-induced MMP3 and MMP9 may work individually or cooperatively to promote cancer progression. Interestingly, it has been reported that hepatitis B virus X protein can also induce MMP3 and MMP9, resulting in enhanced cell motility and invasiveness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056121-Chung1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056121-Yu2">[67]</xref>. MMP3-specific inhibitors can abolish the X protein-induced cell migration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056121-Yu2">[67]</xref> and can also block Zta-induced cell migration and invasion in our study. Since MMP3 may function as a key activator of other MMPs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056121-Chakraborti1">[49]</xref>, blocking this critical protease can be a potential approach to treat EBV-induced, MMP-mediated pathogenesis.</p>
