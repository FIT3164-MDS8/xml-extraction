        <p>The global burden of neonatal and infant mortality due to infection is
                    staggering, particularly in resource-poor settings. Early childhood vaccination
                    is one of the major interventions that can reduce this burden, but there are
                    specific limitations to inducing effective immunity in early life, including
                    impaired neonatal leukocyte production of Th1-polarizing cytokines to many
                    stimuli. Characterizing the ontogeny of Toll-like receptor (TLR)-mediated innate
                    immune responses in infants may shed light on susceptibility to infection in
                    this vulnerable age group, and provide insights into TLR agonists as candidate
                    adjuvants for improved neonatal vaccines. As little is known about the leukocyte
                    responses of infants in resource-poor settings, we characterized production of
                    Th1-, Th2-, and anti-inflammatory- cytokines in response to agonists of TLRs 1-9
                    in whole blood from 120 Gambian infants ranging from newborns (cord blood) to 12
                    months of age. Most of the TLR agonists induced TNFα, IL-1β, IL-6, and
                    IL-10 in cord blood. The greatest TNFα responses were observed for TLR4, -5,
                    and -8 agonists, the highest being the thiazoloquinoline CLO75 (TLR7/8) that
                    also uniquely induced cord blood IFNγ production. For most agonists,
                    TLR-mediated TNFα and IFNγ responses increased from birth to 1 month of
                    age. TLR8 agonists also induced the greatest production of the Th1-polarizing
                    cytokines TNFα and IFNγ throughout the first year of life, although the
                    relative responses to the single TLR8 agonist and the combined TLR7/8 agonist
                    changed with age. In contrast, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-10 responses to most
                    agonists were robust at birth and remained stable through 12 months of age.
                    These observations provide fresh insights into the ontogeny of innate immunity
                    in African children, and may inform development of age-specific adjuvanted
                    vaccine formulations important for global health.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The greatest burden of morbidity and mortality from infectious diseases occurs in
                children under 5 years of age, with the highest rates occurring in resource-poor
                countries. This urgent global issue is the target of United Nations Millennium Goal
                4 to reduce under-five child mortality by two-thirds by 2015 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018185-UNICEF1">[1]</xref>. One of the most effective
                measures to prevent infection is vaccination early in life, in particular at birth
                as it is the most reliable point of healthcare contact <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018185-Demirjian1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018185-vandenBiggelaar1">[3]</xref>. However, young
                children often do not respond to vaccines as efficiently as adults as a result of
                distinct features of their immune systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018185-Kollmann1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018185-Prabhudas1">[8]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Among the distinct features of neonatal immune system is a diminished ability of
                monocytes and antigen-presenting cells (APCs) to generate Th1-polarizing signals in
                response to most stimuli, including reduced production of TNFα and interferon
                gamma (IFNγ) important for host defence against intracellular pathogens and for
                generation of adaptive immune responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018185-Marodi1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018185-Yan1">[11]</xref>. However, the impairment is
                stimulus-specific and some stimuli are able to effectively activate neonatal APCs

      <p>Modifying the innate response may increase the strength of adaptive responses
                required for inducing efficient immunological memory in infants. Until recently, the
                only approved adjuvant component in vaccines was alum. However, the discovery that
                microbial products activate host cells via pattern recognition receptors such as
                Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and enhance adaptive immune responses by triggering
                cytokine production and dendritic cell maturation, has led to TLR agonists being

                highlight the importance of characterizing ontogeny of TLR-mediated responses in
                target populations, including newborns and infants.</p>
      <p>Age-dependent changes in TLR function have been demonstrated in humans by natural
                deficiencies in TLR signaling molecules including a deficiency in IRAK-4 (a kinase
                involved in the TLR signaling cascade) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018185-Picard1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018185-Ku1">[33]</xref> and MyD88 (a TLR adaptor molecule)
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018185-Yan1">[11]</xref> that can
                result in life-threatening infections in infancy and childhood. Of note, infections
                decrease in IRAK-4-deficient children &gt;8 years of age, suggesting a greater
                dependency early in life on TLR signaling for protection against infection. Although
                newborns demonstrate similar basal expression of monocyte TLRs at birth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018185-Levy1">[34]</xref>, neonatal blood
                mononuclear cell responses to TLR agonists are distinct from those of adults, with
                impairment of Th1 cytokine responses (e.g., TNFα, IFNγ) but similar or
                greater production of cytokines with Th2 (IL-6, IL-1β), Th17 (IL-23) and
                anti-inflammatory (IL-10) activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018185-Kollmann1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018185-Levy1">[34]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018185-VandenEijnden1">[42]</xref>. By contrast, cord blood
                responses to TLR8 agonists, including imidazoquinoline compounds and single stranded
                RNAs (ssRNAs), induced robust adult-like TNFα responses raising the possibility
                that TLR8 agonists may serve as effective vaccine adjuvants for newborns and young
                infants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018185-Levy1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018185-Levy3">[43]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Because infant peripheral blood is more difficult to obtain than cord blood,
                relatively less is known about TLR function during infancy. The few infant studies
                available have been conducted in resource-rich settings and indicate that there is a
                marked increase in TLR-mediated Th1 cytokine production within the first 6 months of
                life <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018185-Belderbos1">[13]</xref>,

                knowledge, there are no published studies of TLR function in newborns and infants
                from resource-poor countries and none from the African continent. Such data may be
                of considerable importance as these populations are at high risk of infection, and
                may demonstrate distinct innate response profiles compared to other populations with
                lesser burdens of disease. For example, infants from resource-poor countries often
                respond quite differently to immune stimuli including to BCG vaccination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018185-Lalor1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018185-vandenBiggelaar2">[47]</xref>. In
                addition to providing insight into age-dependent development of TLR-mediated innate
                immunity, characterizing the ontogeny of TLR responses in an African country may
                also inform development of adjuvanted vaccines for high-risk newborns and infants.
                We therefore characterised the production of Th1, Th2, and anti-inflammatory
                cytokines in response to agonists of TLRs 1 – 9 in whole blood cultures
                derived from Gambian infants during the first year of life. We found that cord blood
                Th1-polarising cytokine responses were generally impaired, that TLR8 agonists gave
                the strongest Th1-cytokine responses at birth and that by 1 month of age the
                pro-inflammatory responses to most TLR agonists were increased, with predominance of
                responses to TLR4, -5 and -8 agonists that changed across the first 12 months of
                life.</p>

      <p>Our study evaluated the ontogeny of TLR-mediated <italic>in vitro</italic> whole
                blood cytokine responses during the first year of life in infants from The Gambia
                employing agonists of TLRs 1-9 and blood samples from 8 different age groups. We
                found that cytokine responses of Gambian infants varied between TLR agonists, with
                the greatest responses to TLR8 agonists (ssRNA and CL075), substantial responses to
                TLR4 and TLR5 agonists, and relatively weak responses to TLR1, 2, 3, 7 and 9
                agonists at all ages. Thus the ontogeny of responses is TLR-specific with distinct
                differences across age groups in the first 12 months of life. Most of the previous
                studies exploring TLR-mediated responses of newborns have focused solely on
                comparisons between cord blood and adults <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018185-Kollmann1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018185-Levy1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018185-Angelone1">[40]</xref>. The few studies that have
                also examined infant responses are limited to resource-rich setting and did not
                include the wide range of agonists tested in our study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018185-Nguyen1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018185-Belderbos2">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018185-Vosters1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018185-Yerkovich1">[45]</xref>.</p>
      <p>We found that CL075 (TLR7/8) was the only TLR agonist to induce IFNγ at birth but
                that in general, cord blood pro-inflammatory/Th1-polarizing cytokine responses
                (i.e., TNFα and IFNγ) were lower than at later age groups, in accordance
                with prior studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018185-Kollmann1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018185-Levy1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018185-Belderbos2">[39]</xref>. In contrast, TLR-mediated neonatal IL-6, IL-1β and
                IL-10 production was higher or similar at birth compared to later age groups,
                suggesting that neonatal TLR-mediated responses are biased towards acute phase
                (IL-1β and IL-6) and anti-inflammatory (IL-10) cytokines. We have previously
                shown in 5-day cultures that IL-10 and IL-6 responses to mycobacterial antigens were
                present at birth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018185-Burl1">[50]</xref>. It has been speculated that the bias towards high IL-10
                production may reflect the need to dampen potentially over-exuberant responses to
                the numerous new antigens to which an infant is exposed in early life <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018185-MaduraLarsen1">[51]</xref>. Greater
                IL-6 to TNFα ratios have been found in cord blood compared to adults, both in
                response to <italic>in vitro</italic> stimulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018185-Levy2">[41]</xref> and with respect to basal serum
                levels during the first week of life <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018185-Angelone1">[40]</xref>. Our findings indicate a
                similar polarisation in our cohort with greater IL-6 to TNFα ratios at birth
                compared to 12 months of age. Relatively high IL-6 production in newborns likely
                contributes to initiation of an acute phase response at birth that may serve to
                clear perinatally-acquired microbes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018185-Levy4">[52]</xref>. In addition, IL-6 enhances both differentiation of Th17
                cells and production of IL-17, and thereby may enhance neutrophil- and antimicrobial
                peptide-based host defence at neonatal mucosal and epithelial barriers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018185-Levy4">[52<bold>]</bold></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018185-Bettelli1">[<bold/>56]</xref>. That this neonatal
                bias towards TLR-mediated IL-6 and IL-10 responses is evident <italic>in
                    vivo</italic> was recently demonstrated in a field trial of alum-adjuvanted
                pneumococcal conjugate vaccine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018185-vandenBiggelaar1">[3]</xref>.</p>
      <p>For most TLR agonists the major effect of age occurred within the first month of life
                during which time TLR-mediated TNFα and IFNγ cytokine production increased,
                suggesting early maturation in the ability to mount these responses. Whether this
                maturation in cytokine production reflects changes in the adenosine system that
                serves to limit production of TNFα in human newborn cord blood <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018185-Levy2">[41]</xref>, will be the
                subject of future studies. The only other study that reported responses in 1 month
                old infants was conducted by Belderbos <italic>et al</italic> in Holland, which also
                showed increased pro-inflammatory responses (e.g., IL-12p70 and IFNα) from birth
                to 1 month of age in response to TLR3, -4, -7 and -9 agonists but similar levels of
                IL-10 production in response to TLR3, -4 and -9 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018185-Belderbos2">[39]</xref>. That study found that
                loxoribine (TLR7)-induced IL-10 responses increased by 1 month of age, in accord
                with our observation of a borderline increase at 1 month of age
                (p = 0.05) using the TLR7 agonist Guardiquimod™. A
                Belgian study by Ngyuen <italic>et al</italic> also found that LPS-induced cord
                blood production of IL-10 and IL-6 was greater than in later age groups (6-9 months
                and 12 months of age). Taken together, our current study and those by Belderbos
                    <italic>et al</italic>
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018185-Belderbos2">[39]</xref>, and
                Vosters <italic>et al</italic>
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018185-Vosters1">[44]</xref> indicate
                that for most TLR agonists, IL-10 production is largely similar from birth through
                to 18 months of age.</p>
      <p>A comparison of the few studies of infant TLR function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018185-Nguyen1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018185-Belderbos2">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018185-Vosters1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018185-Yerkovich1">[45]</xref> and our current study
                indicates that Gambian infants have broadly similar TLR-mediated responses to those
                found in a Western European environment. However, Ngyuen <italic>et al</italic>
                studying a Belgian cohort found a slower postnatal increase in TNFα production
                in response to LPS from birth compared to our study, such that adult levels were not
                reached until 6 months of age <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018185-Nguyen1">[37]</xref>, whereas our Gambian cohort demonstrated LPS-induced
                TNFα responses that peaked at 1 month of and then remained stable to 12 months
                of age. Earlier maturation of LPS-induced TNFα responses in Gambian infants than
                in the European infants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018185-Nguyen1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018185-Belderbos2">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018185-Yerkovich1">[45]</xref> may reflect more rapid polarisation to Th1 responses in a
                resource-poor setting, in accord with the hygiene hypothesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018185-Belderbos1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018185-Strachan1">[57]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018185-Rook1">[58]</xref>, and may also suggest that TLR4
                agonists, currently used in several vaccine formulations (e.g., MPL<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018185-Casella1">[59]</xref>), may be
                useful vaccine adjuvants in early infancy.</p>
      <p>Although TLR8 agonist-induced cord blood TNFα responses have been shown to be
                greater than TNFα responses to agonists of TLRs 1<bold>–</bold>7 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018185-Levy3">[43]</xref>, little is known
                regarding cytokine responses to TLR8 agonists such as ssRNA (TLR8 only) and CL075
                (TLR7/8 agonist) during the first year of life. Our study confirmed the greater
                responsiveness to TLR8 agonists in cord blood and extended the finding by
                demonstrating that TLR8 agonists were the predominant inducers of pro-inflammatory
                cytokines up to 12 months of age in Gambian infants. We also found that the combined
                TLR7/8 agonist (CL075) induced more TNFα than the TLR7 selective agonist
                Gardiquimod™ or the TLR8 selective agonist ssRNA up to 1 month of age. By 12
                months of age however, there was a trend towards reduced TNFα production in
                response to the combined agonist compared to the single TLR8 agonist. Likewise,
                IFNγ production was similar between the two agonists up to 6 months of age after
                which CL075-induced IFNγ diminished relative to ssRNA-induced IFNγ and
                remained lower up to 12 months of age. It should be noted however, that in addition
                to differences between TLR7 and TLR8 selectivity, differences in biochemical
                structures between ssRNA and the low-molecular weight thiazoloquinolone, CL075 may
                affect TLR-independent variables (e.g., solubility, protein binding and cell
                penetration) that may also contribute to distinct bioactivities. The correlations
                between <italic>IFNG</italic> mRNA and IFNγ protein in response to ssRNA and
                CL075 indicate that the ontogeny of TLR-mediated IFNγ production is manifest at
                the transcriptional level. Given the importance of IL-12 to IFNγ production
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018185-Jacobson2">[49]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018185-Gately1">[60]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018185-Robinson1">[61]</xref> and the
                observed correlations of TLR-mediated IFNγ protein with <italic>IL12B</italic>
                message, TLR8-mediated IFNγ responses may also involve activation of
                    <italic>IL-12B</italic> (that encodes for IL-12p40)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018185-Jacobson2">[49]</xref>. However, expression of
                    <italic>IL-12A</italic> (that encodes for IL-12p35) was very low at all three
                ages tested, in agreement with Western European studies that demonstrate deficiency
                in TLR-mediated IL-12p35 production by neonatal DCs, contributing to impaired
                neonatal IFNγ responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018185-Goriely2">[62]</xref>. Analysis of TLR-mediated production of additional
                cytokines that may influence adaptive immune responses, including IL-4 (Th2) and
                IL-17 (Th17), is of importance and should be included in future studies.</p>
      <p>Overall, characterizing the ontogeny of innate immune responses may eventually inform
                selection of adjuvant vaccine formulations that are tailored for certain age groups.
                Indeed, recent studies highlight that appropriate immunologic signatures can predict
                vaccine efficacy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018185-Pulendran1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0018185-Pulendran2">[63]</xref>. To the extent that TNFα and IFNγ may be markers
                of strong Th1-polarising responses required for induction of cell-mediated immunity,
                and that the whole blood <italic>in vitro</italic> responses measured in our study
                may reflect those that would pertain <italic>in vivo</italic>, our data suggest that
                vaccine adjuvants based on TLR4, -5 or -8 agonists, may be particularly effective in
                protecting newborns and infants against pathogens requiring cell-mediated
                immunity.</p>
