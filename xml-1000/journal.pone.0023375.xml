        <p>In recent years, enamel matrix derivative (EMD) has garnered much interest in the dental field for its apparent bioactivity that stimulates regeneration of periodontal tissues including periodontal ligament, cementum and alveolar bone. Despite its widespread use, the underlying cellular mechanisms remain unclear and an understanding of its biological interactions could identify new strategies for tissue engineering. Previous <italic>in vitro</italic> research has demonstrated that EMD promotes premature osteoblast clustering at early time points. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the influence of cell clustering on vital osteoblast cell-cell communication and adhesion molecules, connexin 43 (cx43) and N-cadherin (N-cad) as assessed by immunofluorescence imaging, real-time PCR and Western blot analysis. In addition, differentiation markers of osteoblasts were quantified using alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin and von Kossa staining. EMD significantly increased the expression of connexin 43 and N-cadherin at early time points ranging from 2 to 5 days. Protein expression was localized to cell membranes when compared to control groups. Alkaline phosphatase activity was also significantly increased on EMD-coated samples at 3, 5 and 7 days post seeding. Interestingly, higher activity was localized to cell cluster regions. There was a 3 fold increase in osteocalcin and bone sialoprotein mRNA levels for osteoblasts cultured on EMD-coated culture dishes. Moreover, EMD significantly increased extracellular mineral deposition in cell clusters as assessed through von Kossa staining at 5, 7, 10 and 14 days post seeding. We conclude that EMD up-regulates the expression of vital osteoblast cell-cell communication and adhesion molecules, which enhances the differentiation and mineralization activity of osteoblasts. These findings provide further support for the clinical evidence that EMD increases the speed and quality of new bone formation <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Bone remodeling is a complex lifelong process that requires precise control of bone-resorbing osteoclasts and bone-forming osteoblasts for the maintenance of aging bone and repair of bone injuries. Osteoblasts are at the center of these processes by controlling matrix production and mineralization, receiving and processing mechanical and chemical signals to bone and most likely directing osteoclast function. This level of coordination demands sophisticated cell communication. Osteoblasts engage in a variety of cell-cell interactions including communication via soluble factors such as cytokines and growth factors as well as direct cell-cell adhesion molecules such as those forming adherens junctions and gap junctions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0023375-Doty1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0023375-Palumbo1">[2]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Adherens junctions are intercellular structures that are formed through hemophilic, calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion via cadherins. These molecules constitue a class of 30 single chain integral membrane glycoproteins composed of a long N-terminal extracellular domain, a single transmembrane domain, and a small intracellular C-terminal tail <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0023375-Gumbiner1">[3]</xref>. The intracellular domain anchors to the actin cytoskeleton via multiple protein complexes including α- and β-catenin which control Wnt signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0023375-Nelson1">[4]</xref>. Two cadherins are predominantly expressed in osteoblasts, N-cadherin (N-cad) and cadherin-11. Knockout models have indicated that the loss of N-cad disrupts cell-cell adhesion more severely than the loss of cadherin-11 in osteoblasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0023375-DiBenedetto1">[5]</xref>. Cadherins also play essential roles in fetal development of mesenchymal tissues including morphogenesis, osteogenesis and chondrocyte condensation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0023375-Gumbiner1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0023375-Marie1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0023375-DeLise1">[7]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Gap junctions are aqueous transmembrane channels that connect the cytoplasm of two adjacent cells and allow the diffusion of small molecules with a molecular mass of less than 1 kDa such as small metabolites, ions, and intracellular signaling molecules (calcium, cAMP, and inositol triphosphate) to pass through <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0023375-Alexander1">[8]</xref>. Each gap junction pore is formed of connexins which oligomerize to form hemichannels that tightly dock with hemichannels from the adjacent cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0023375-Beyer1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0023375-Saez1">[10]</xref>. The connexin superfamily includes more than 20 genes, whose products have different molecular properties that influence the permeability of each gap junction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0023375-Beyer1">[9]</xref>. The main connexin in osteoblasts, connexin 43 (cx43) is the most abundant gap junction protein in the skeleton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0023375-Stains1">[11]</xref>. The role of cx43 in osteoblast differentiation and mineralization has been demonstrated by <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments. The inhibition of cx43 gene expression by antisense transfection or knockout-cx43 has consistently been associated with loss of gap junctional coupling and reduced osteoblast differentiation potential as assessed by downregulation of alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, bone sialoprotein and mineralization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0023375-Lecanda1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0023375-Schiller1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0023375-Li1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0023375-Lecanda2">[15]</xref>. In contrast, overexpression of cx43 results in an enhancement of gap junctional intercellular communication and expression of an osteogenic phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0023375-Lecanda1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0023375-Gramsch1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0023375-Ziambaras1">[17]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The clearest demonstration of the essential role of cx43 in bone formation has been observed in knockout mice lacking cx43 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0023375-Lecanda2">[15]</xref>. These animals exhibit profound defects in intramembranous and endochondral ossification of the skeleton, leading to skull abnormalities, brittle, misshapen ribs and delayed mineralization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0023375-Lecanda2">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0023375-Chung1">[18]</xref>. They display many similarities with the phenotypes reported from human oculodentodigital dysplasia (ODDD), an autosomal dominant disease caused by any one of over 60 mutations in the gene GJA1 encoding Cx43 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0023375-Flenniken1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0023375-Paznekas1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0023375-Laird1">[21]</xref>. Recent research also suggests a role in wound healing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0023375-Churko1">[22]</xref>. An improved understanding of the regulation of gap junctions in bone could also provide further insights into regulatory mechanisms of osteoblast differentiation for further therapy in the treatment of bone loss diseases such as osteoporosis and periodontitis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0023375-Khosla1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0023375-Sambrook1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0023375-Bartold1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0023375-Megson1">[26]</xref>.</p>
      <p>One procedure for the regeneration of bone is the application of an enamel matrix derivative (EMD) which has been used clinically for the treatment of various types of bony defects located at periodontitis diseased teeth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0023375-Sculean1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0023375-Esposito1">[28]</xref>. EMD is extracted from developing porcine teeth, the major component of which are amelogenins, a family of hydrophobic proteins that account for more than 90% of the total protein content <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0023375-Gestrelius1">[29]</xref>. The remaining components of EMD include enamelins, such as proline-rich enamelin, sheathlin, tuftelin, amelotin and apin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0023375-Carinci1">[30]</xref>. The direct effects of EMD on bone regeneration have primarily been evaluated in periodontal intrabony and class II furcation defects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0023375-Sculean2">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0023375-Sculean3">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0023375-Sculean4">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0023375-Jepsen1">[34]</xref>. However, findings from <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments indicate that EMD may also influence healing/regeneration of non-tooth related bone defects. <italic>In vitro</italic> studies with human, rat and mouse osteoblasts showed increased proliferation and/or differentiation in the presence of EMD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0023375-Carinci1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0023375-Schwartz1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0023375-Jiang1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0023375-Hagewald1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0023375-Schwarz1">[38]</xref>. <italic>In vivo</italic> treatment of perforated rat femurs with EMD significantly increased newly formed bone in 7 days when compared to untreated perforated femurs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0023375-Kawana1">[39]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Despite the widespread use of EMD, the underlying cellular mechanisms remain unclear and an understanding of its biological interactions could identify new strategies for tissue engineering. Previous <italic>in vitro</italic> research showed that EMD promoted osteoblast clustering at early time points <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0023375-Miron1">[40]</xref>. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the influence of cell clustering on vital osteoblast cell-cell communication and adhesion molecules, cx43 and N-cad.</p>

        <title>Surface Coating with EMD</title>
        <p>EMD was prepared according to Institut Straumann AG standard operating protocols. 30 mg of EMD was dissolved in 3 ml of 4°C sterile 0.1% acetic acid. For experiments, stock EMD was diluted 100× in 0.1 M carbonate buffer at 4°C giving a working solution of 100 µg/ml. 1 ml of EMD solution was poured onto each 24 well culture dishes and incubated overnight at 4°C. Following incubation, dishes were rinsed with 1 ml phosphate buffered saline (PBS) twice at 4°C. Uncoated 24 well culture dishes were used as a control.</p>

Primary human osteoblasts were removed from the tissue culture plastic using trypsin solution (Invitrogen, Basel, Switzerland). Osteoblasts used for experimental seeding were from passages 4–6. During cell seeding, α-MEM medium was supplemented with 50 µg/ml ascorbic acid and 2 mM β-glycerophosphate to promote osteoblast differentiation. Primary osteoblasts were seeded at a density of 10,000 cells in 24 well culture plates for all experiments. For experiments lasting longer than 5 days, medium was replaced twice weekly.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In the past 15 years, a plethora of research has sought to advance our understanding of the functions of enamel matrix proteins (EMPs) have beyond amelogenesis. EMD has been previously shown to influence osteoblast differentiation using a wide range of cell models (MG-63, MC3T3-E1, Kusa/A 1, 2T9 cells, rat calvarial osteoblasts) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0023375-Hagewald1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0023375-Miron1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0023375-He1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0023375-Weishaupt1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0023375-Yoneda1">[44]</xref>. EMD increased ALP activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0023375-He1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0023375-Reseland1">[45]</xref>, mineral nodule formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0023375-Wu1">[46]</xref> as well as markers for osteoblast differentiation such as BSP and OC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0023375-Miron1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0023375-Weishaupt1">[43]</xref>. An unexpected observation in our previous study was the formation of cell clusters on EMD-coated surfaces after a period of 24 hours <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0023375-Miron1">[40]</xref>. This phenomenon resembles mesenchymal condensation, which is a pivotal stage in the development of skeletal and other mesenchymal tissues. Condensation is the result of an active movement of previously dispersed cells that cluster together, differentiate and start to build tissues such as cartilage, bone, muscle, tendon, kidney and lung <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0023375-DeLise1">[7]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In this study, the formation of early cell clusters significantly increased cell-cell contact proteins cx43 and N-cad. In previous studies, the upregulation of N-cad mRNA levels has consistently been associated with early nodule formation and mineralization suggesting a role in bone formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0023375-Lin1">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0023375-Ferrari1">[48]</xref>. This phenomenon likely pertains to the signaling complexes associated with cadherins. Type 1 cadherins play an essential role in the structural organization and function of cells by linking cadherins through α- and β-catenin to the actin cytoskeleton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0023375-Nelson1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0023375-Jamora1">[49]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0023375-Olkku1">[50]</xref>. N-cad also activates Wnt signaling which has been the focus of major investigation in recent years for osteoblast differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0023375-DiBenedetto1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0023375-Cho1">[51]</xref>.</p>
      <p>An interesting observation in this study was the upregulation of the gap junction protein cx43 at similar time points as N-cad. The role of gap junctions in cell differentiation has also been extensively studied. In a variety of cell culture systems, cx43 induced osteoblast differentiation and mineralization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0023375-Lecanda1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0023375-Li1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0023375-Lecanda2">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0023375-Hayashi1">[52]</xref>. Interestingly, connexins retain an extremely short half-life of a few hours probably to respond to physiological requirements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0023375-Laird1">[21]</xref>. In this study, we found a quick increase in cx43 and N-cad expression as early as 24 hours post seeding on EMD-coated samples. Cx43 expression was maintained for up to 14 days. However, increases seemed to precede the expression of osteoblast differentiation markers such as ALP, OC and matrix mineralization. Gap junctional intercellular signaling could certainly explain these observations. Molecules transported through gap junctions, such as cAMP are known to play critical roles in the regulation of OC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0023375-Boudreaux1">[53]</xref> and BSP gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0023375-Yang1">[54]</xref> in osteoblasts. Furthermore, intracellular calcium fluctuations signal the activation of genes in different cell types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0023375-vanHaasteren1">[55]</xref>. There exist many examples on the dependence of cell coupling for the normal function of highly differentiated tissues is not exclusive to bone. Restoration of gap junctional communication in thyroid cells increases thyroglobulin expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0023375-Statuto1">[56]</xref>. Steroidogenic response of bovine and human adrenal fasciculo-reticularis cells to corticotrophin was dependent on junctional intercellular communication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0023375-MunariSilem1">[57]</xref> and muscle cell contraction in response to alpha1-adrenergic stimulation was dependent on cell coupling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0023375-Christ1">[58]</xref>. Results from the present study further support the view that gap junctional communication is important for cell differentiation.</p>
      <p>The ability for osteoblasts to respond to biomaterials such as EMD shows further promise for tissue engineering applications in periodontal and alveolar defects. An interesting aspect which remains unsolved is the ability for EMD to promote cell cluster formation. The possibility exists that EMD may contain chemokinetic proteins or may stimulate cells to produce chemotactic factors that attract other cells. In this regard, EMD is thought to contain bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0023375-Takayama1">[59]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0023375-Saito1">[60]</xref> and transforming growth factor β <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0023375-Kawase1">[61]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0023375-Suzuki1">[62]</xref>. BMPs have been the focus of intense investigation for clinical application and studies have demonstrated a role for BMPs in the formation of many organs and patterning of the skeleton by inducing the formation of mesenchymal condensations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0023375-Wu2">[63]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0023375-Barna1">[64]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In the present study, it was observed that Runx2 mRNA levels remained unchanged. Other authors have also investigated the influence of EMD on gene expression of Runx2 and have not observed any significant differences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0023375-Miron1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0023375-He1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0023375-Weishaupt1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0023375-Reseland1">[45]</xref>. It has previously been reported by Komori et al. that Runx2 is necessary for early osteoblast differentiation however at later time points, inhibits immature osteoblasts from differentiating into mature osteoblasts and osteocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0023375-Komori1">[65]</xref>. Given that the primary cells isolated in the present study were isolated from alveolar bone, it is likely that these cells were comprised primary of pre-osteoblasts and/or osteoblasts which had already differentiated past the mesenchymal stem cell phenotype and no longer require Runx2 gene expression.</p>
      <p>More recent research has focused on the roles of different proteins found in EMD. Mumulidu et al. used high performance liquid chromatography to fractionate EMD into three major components: a 20 kDa, 12+9 kDa and 5 kDa fractions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0023375-Mumulidu1">[66]</xref>. Amelogenin (20 kDa), the major component in EMD is an adhesion molecule that was initially thought to be responsible for the effects observed in EMD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0023375-Hoang1">[67]</xref>. Further analysis has revealed that the 5 kDa component of EMD also contains many bioactive molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0023375-Mumulidu1">[66]</xref>. More recently, Johnson et al. observed that each of the 3 fractions stimulates different cellular mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0023375-Johnson1">[68]</xref>. These findings suggested roles for multiple proteins in the attachment, proliferation and differentiation of osteoblasts by EMD.</p>
      <p>To clarify the roles of individual proteins on cellular mechanisms, the use of recombinant EMPs have been studied. Amelogenin, the main component of EMD, increases cell adhesion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0023375-Hoang1">[67]</xref>, proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0023375-Huang1">[69]</xref> and differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0023375-Du1">[70]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0023375-Shimizu1">[71]</xref>. It also binds to heparan sulfate and BMP2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0023375-Saito2">[72]</xref> and uses the β-catenin and Wnt pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0023375-Matsuzawa1">[73]</xref>. Recent research with recombinant ameloblastin, a second protein found in EMD, concluded that not only amelogenin has growth factor-like activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0023375-ZeichnerDavid1">[74]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0023375-Tamburstuen1">[75]</xref>. Still, the combination of proteins and growth factors present in EMD seems to improve the <italic>in vitro</italic> outcomes over individual recombinant proteins.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, the observations from this study indicate that upregulation of cell-cell contact proteins at early stages in osteoblasts seeded on EMD-coated samples might be a mechanism for accelerating bone formation. Gap junctional intercellular communication constitutes a fundamental mechanism of differentiated cells and communication through channels which directs the control and regulation of gene expression and provides a means to respond cooperatively to a stimulus. Furthermore, the clinical evidence of EMD supports the hypothesis that gap junctional communication provides a means for a group of fully differentiated cells to perform a function coordinately not only in bone, but also in other tissues.</p>
