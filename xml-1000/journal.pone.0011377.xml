<p>Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) has been one of the most economically important diseases affecting swine industry worldwide and causes great economic losses each year. PRRS virus (PRRSV) replicates mainly in porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) and dendritic cells (DCs) and develops persistent infections, antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), interstitial pneumonia and immunosuppression. But the molecular mechanisms of PRRSV infection still are poorly understood. Here we report on the first genome-wide host transcriptional responses to classical North American type PRRSV (N-PRRSV) strain CH 1a infection using Solexa/Illumina's digital gene expression (DGE) system, a tag-based high-throughput transcriptome sequencing method, and analyse systematically the relationship between pulmonary gene expression profiles after N-PRRSV infection and infection pathology. Our results suggest that N-PRRSV appeared to utilize multiple strategies for its replication and spread in infected pigs, including subverting host innate immune response, inducing an anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory state as well as developing ADE. Upregulation expression of virus-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules and inflammatory enzymes and inflammatory cells, antibodies, complement activation were likely to result in the development of inflammatory responses during N-PRRSV infection processes. N-PRRSV-induced immunosuppression might be mediated by apoptosis of infected cells, which caused depletion of immune cells and induced an anti-inflammatory cytokine response in which they were unable to eradicate the primary infection. Our systems analysis will benefit for better understanding the molecular pathogenesis of N-PRRSV infection, developing novel antiviral therapies and identifying genetic components for swine resistance/susceptibility to PRRS.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS), also called “blue ear” disease due to a typical, but not often observed hallmark of “blue ears”, is widely accepted as being one of the most economically important diseases affecting swine industry. Since its first appearance in the late 1980s in the US and Europe, PRRS has spread worldwide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-Albina1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-Baoqing1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-Carlsson1">[3]</xref>. PRRS is characterized with high mortality in piglets, reproductive failure (late-term abortions and stillbirths, premature farrowing, mummified pigs) in pregnant sows and respiratory disease (interstitial pneumonia, respiratory difficulties) in nursery and grower/finishing pigs, causing highly significant economic losses to the swine industry worldwide, resulting in &gt;$ 560.32 million losses each year in the US alone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-Neumann1">[4]</xref>. The etiologic agent of PRRS is PRRS virus (PRRSV), a small enveloped, linear, single, positive-stranded RNA virus, which is a member of the family Arteriviridae which includes lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus, equine arteritis virus, and simian hemorrhagic fever virus and enters in the newly established order of the Nidovirales together with the Coronaviridae and Roniviridae family <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-Cavanagh1">[5]</xref>. Since the initial PRRS outbreaks in mainland China in 1996 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-Baoqing1">[2]</xref>, the PRRSV has spread widely and the infection rate of some swine herds is up to 90% <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-Chen1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-Yuan1">[7]</xref>. In June 2006, a so-called “high fever” pig disease large-scalely emerged in China, studies showed that highly virulent Chinese-type PRRSV (H-PRRSV) is the major causative pathogen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-Tian1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-Li1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-Zhou1">[10]</xref>. However until recently, all PRRSV isolates, including H-PRRSV isolates in China, were identified as the North American type PRRSV (NA PRRSV) genotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-Chen1">[6]</xref>. Since 2006, the classical NA PRRSV (N-PRRSV) and H-PRRSV strains coexist in China <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-Chen1">[6]</xref>. PRRSV replicates predominantly in the alveolar macrophage of the lung, can induce prolonged viremia, and cause persistent infections that last for months after initial infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-Kimman1">[11]</xref>. Infected pigs develop a strong and rapid humoral response but these initial antibodies do not confer protection and can even be harmful by mediating an antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), since these antibodies can facilitate the entry of the virus into targets cells <italic>in vitro</italic>. In contrast, induction of neutralizing antibodies (NAs) is severedly delayed and their levels remain low, which can not eliminate effectively PRRSV-infected cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-Mateu1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-Costers1">[13]</xref>. Because of these features of PRRSV infection, PRRS has been one of the most challenging subjects of research in veterinary viral immunology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-Mateu1">[12]</xref>.</p>
<p>Regulation of immune responses and genetic resistance to infectious viral diseases is an area of concern for human and swine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-Lunney1">[14]</xref>. PRRSV strongly modulates the host's immune responses, and changes the host's gene expression. Studies showed that PRRSV inhibits type I interferons (IFN-α/β, SPI IFN), especially IFN-α <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-Albina2">[15]</xref>, and induces interleukin-10 (IL10) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-Suradhat1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-Suradhat2">[17]</xref>. Because the primary cellular target of PRRSV is the porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) of the lung, several studies have analysed the immune responses of PAMs to PRRSV infection. One group <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-Zhang1">[18]</xref> used differential display reverse-transcription PCR to identify molecular genetic changes within PRRSV-infected PAMs over a 24 h pi period. Their results suggest that myxovirus resistance 1 (MX1) and ubiquitin specific proteases (USP) genes may play important roles in clinical disease during PRRSV infection. Notably, one recent paper on genome-wide transcriptional response of PAMs following infection with the Lelystad PRRSV strain (European type, EU PRRSV) using Affymetrix microarrays has been published during the preparation of our manuscript <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-Genini1">[19]</xref>. They found that the expression of beta interferon 1 (IFN-β) was strongly upregulated while the expression of IL-10 and TNF-α was weakly upregulated. Almost in the same time, the other group employed Serial Analysis of Gene Expression (SAGE) to examine the global expression of genes in VR-2332 PRRSV strain (North American type, NA PRRSV)–infected PAMs. They identified over 400 unique tags with significantly altered expression levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-Miller1">[20]</xref>. <italic>In vitro</italic> studies will be useful for investigating how PRRSV modifies genes expression in primary target cells, such as PAMs. However, many of the outstanding issues will be answered only in the context of PRRSV-infected animals. Hence, the characterization of host immune response under <italic>in vivo</italic> environment to PRRSV is still an area in urgent need of investigation. Lung pathogenesis is a major feature of PRRSV infection. Moreover, in addition to serving as a source of protein in the human diet, the pig is also an excellent biomedical model for humans because of the similarity in size and physiology, and in organ development and disease progression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-Lunney1">[14]</xref>. Thus, understanding the host's immune response to PRRSV infection is important not only for swine production but also for human consumption. However, to date, the immune response to PRRSV in porcine lung has not been analyzed by transcriptome profiling. Next generation high-throughput sequencing technology has been adapted for transcriptome analysis because of the inexpensive production of large volumes of sequence data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-Velculescu1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-Licatalosi1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-Sorek1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-Metzker1">[24]</xref>. The technology developed by Illumina (formerly Solexa sequencing) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-Bennett1">[25]</xref>, which is also referred to as Digital Gene Expression (DGE) tag profiling, allows identification of millions of short RNAs in a sample and of differentially expressed genes without the need for prior annotations.</p>
<p>Here we employed the Illumina Genome Analyzer platform to perform a Digital Gene Expression analysis of the porcine lung transcriptome response to N-PRRSV infection, and used histopathology examination to analyze the pulmonary pathological changes of the infected-porcine lungs. The relationship between pulmonary gene expression profiles after N-PRRSV infection and infection pathology was systematically analyzed. The comprehensive analysis of the global host response induced by N-PRRSV suggested an inflammatory response, mediated by multiple inflammatory molecules early during infection that induced tissue injury, an immunosuppressive state, mediated by apoptosis of infected cells, which caused depletion of immune cells and induced an anti-inflammatory cytokine response in which they were unable to eradicate the primary infection. Our systems analysis will benefit for better understanding the molecular pathogenesis of N-PRRSV infection, developing novel antiviral therapies and identifying genetic components for swine resistance/susceptibility to PRRS.</p>

<title>Experimental animals and tissue collection</title>
<p>Nine conventionally-reared, healthy 6-week-old, crossbred weaned pigs (Landrace×Yorkshire) were selected from a high-health commercial farm that has historically been free of all major pig diseases, such as PRRSV, porcine circovirus type 2, classical swine fever virus, porcine parvovirus, pseudorabies virus, swine influenza virus and Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae infections. All pigs were PRRSV-seronegative determined by ELISA (HerdChek PRRS 2XR; IDEXX Laboratories) and absence of PRRSV tested by RT-PCR. Pigs were randomly assigned to two groups in the experiment and raised in isolation rooms. Six pigs were inoculated with 6 ml viral suspension (4 ml intranasally and 2 ml intramuscularly) of classical North American type PRRSV (N-PRRSV) strain CH 1a, isolated from China in 1996, gifted by Dr. Zhang Guihong, South China Agricultural University) at a dose of 10<sup>6.0</sup> TCID50 ml<sup>−1</sup> on day 0. Three uninfected negative control (UNC) pigs were treated similarly with an identical volume of DMEM culture media from uninfected MARC-145 cells 1 day prior to experimental infection, and were immediately necropsied. N-PRRSV-inoculated pigs were clinically examined daily and rectal body temperatures were recorded from days −2 to 7 pi. Viral re-isolates were performed after the pigs were killed. The infected group showed positive, and the UNC group was negative. Tissue homogenates and serum were examined by N-PRRSV-specific Quantitative PCR (QPCR). The oligonucleotide primers used were NSP2F(<named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-GTGGGTCGGCACCAGTT-3′</named-content>) and NSP2R(<named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′- GACGCAGACAAATCCAGAGG-3′</named-content>), designed in the gene segment encoding for NSP2. The TaqMan probe, <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′ FAM-CACAGTTCTACGCGGTGCAGG -TAMRA 3′</named-content>, was synthesized. Three infected pigs randomly chosen were necropsied at each time point of 96 h pi and 168 h pi. Lung samples were collected from UNC group (C), three pigs at 96 h pi (N96), three pigs at 168 h pi (N168) and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen for RNA isolation or fixed in 10% neutralized buffered formalin for histological processing.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2c">
<title>Histopathology</title>
<p>Lungs of UNC and experimentally infected pigs were processed routinely for haematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) and immunohistochemistry staining, as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-Qiu1">[26]</xref>.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2d">
<title>RNA extraction, library construction and sequencing</title>
<p>Total RNA was extracted from frozen lungs using standard protocols (Trizol) and then treated with DNase to remove potential genomic DNA contamination according to the manufactures's protocols. RNA integrity and concentration were evaluated by Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies).</p>
<p>For RNA library construction and deep sequencing, equal quantities of RNA samples from three UNC individual lungs were pooled, RNA samples from the three infected pig lungs (N96) were pooled, and RNA samples from the three infected individual lungs (N168) were pooled. Approximately 6 µg of RNA representing each group were submitted to Solexa (now Illumina Inc.) for sequencing.</p>
<p>Sequence tag preparation was done with Illumina's Digital Gene Expression Tag Profiling Kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. In brief, mRNA was isolated from 6µg total RNA by binding the mRNA to a magnetic oligo bead. First- and second-strand cDNA were synthesized while the mRNA was attached to the beads. The double stranded cDNAs were digested with NlaIII to wash away all fragmens other than the 3′ CATG fragment attached to the oligo bead. Then GEX NlaIII Adapter 1 was ligated at the site of NlaIII cleavage. In addition, GEX NlaIII Adapter 1 contains the sequence for the restriction enzyme MmeI, subsequently, we applied the restriction enzyme MmeI to create the 17 bp tag. The GEX Adapter 2 was ligated at the site of MmeI cleavage. A PCR with 12 cycles was performed with two primers that anneal to the ends of the adapters to enrich the adapter-ligated cDNA construct. The resulting 85 bp fragments were purified from 6% Novex TBE PAGE gel. Subsequently, the purified cDNA tags were sequenced on the Illumina Cluster Station and Genome Analyzer. Image recognition and base calling were performed using the Illumina Pipeline.</p>

<title>Analysis of sequencing data</title>
<p>All data is MIAME compliant. The raw data (tag sequences and counts) has been submitted to Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) under series GSE19970. For the raw data, we filtered adaptor tags, low quality tags and tags of copy number  = 1 to get clean tags. Subsequently, we classified the clean tags according their copy number in the library and show their percentage in the total clean tags and analyzed saturation of the library.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2f">
<title>Tag mapping</title>
<p>The preprocessed database of all possible CATG +17-nt tag sequences was created, using <italic>sus scrofa</italic> UniGene (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/UniGene/UGOrg.cgi?TAXID=9823" xlink:type="simple">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/UniGene/UGOrg.cgi?TAXID=9823</ext-link>, UniGene Build #35 <italic>Sus scrofa</italic>, Nov, 7th, 2008) from NCBI. For monitoring the mapping events on both strands, both the sense and the complementary antisense sequences were included in the data collection. Information on the position of polyadenylation signals was also collected from the transcript dababase. Then we aligned all clean tags to the reference sequences, and unambiguous tags were annotated. We counted the clean tag number corresponding to each gene.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2g">
<title>Differential expression (DE) detection</title>
<p>To compare the DE of gene across samples (N96/C, N168/C, N168/N96), the number of raw clean tags in each library was normalized to Tags Per Million (TPM) to obtain normalized gene expression level. DE detection of gene or tag across samples was performed according to the previous description <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-Audic1">[27]</xref>. Genes were deemed significantly differentially expressed with a P-value &lt;0.005, a false discovery rate (FDR) &lt;0.01 and an estimated absolute log2-fold change &gt;0.5 in sequence counts across libraries.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2h">
<title>Quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis</title>
<p>In order to verify the DGE results, we used qPCR analysis. The RNA samples used for the qPCR assays were both the same as for the DGE experiments and independent RNA extractions from biological replicates. qPCRs were done on the Lightcycler480 (Roche), with SYBR-Green detection (SYBR PrimeScript RT-PCR Kit, TaKaRa Biotechnology Co., Ltd.), according to the manufacture's instruction. Each cDNA was analyzed in triplicate, after which the average threshold cycle (Ct) was calculated per sample. The relative expression levels were calculated with the 2<sup>−ΔΔCt</sup> method. The results were normalized to the expression level of HPRT1 and relative to the C sample.</p>

<title>Mapping of the DE genes to pig QTLs regions of health traits</title>
<p>Through browsing all health traits of Pig Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) database (PigQTLdb, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.animalgenome.org/QTLdb/pig.html" xlink:type="simple">http://www.animalgenome.org/QTLdb/pig.html</ext-link>) by trait classes, we obtained mapping details of QTL on the corresponding pig chromosome. Then pig Affymetrix elements corresponding to health trait QTL regions were downloaded to an excel file. By matching the ID of DE genes to all genes in the QTL regions, we obtained DE genes of the corresponding QTL region.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2j">
<title>Pathway analysis of DE genes</title>
<p>Pathway analysis was mainly based on the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database. Two-side Fisher's exact test with a multiple testing and χ2 test were used to classify the pathway category. The false discovery rate (FDR) was used to correct the P-value. We chose only pathway categories that had a P&lt;0.05. Within the significant category, the enrichment Re was given by: <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0011377.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (Re = ENRICHMENT), where n<sub>f</sub> is the number of flagged proteins within the particular category, n is the total number of proteins within the same category, Nf is the number of flagged proteins in the protein reference database list, N is the total number of proteins in the gene reference database list.</p>

<title>STC (Series Test of Cluster) and STC-GO (Series Test Cluster of Gene Ontology) analysis</title>
<p>STC is implemented entirely in java. The clustering algorithm first selects a set of distinct and representative temporal expression profiles. These model profiles are selected independent of the data. The clustering algorithm then assigns each gene passing the filtering criteria to the model profile that most closely matches the gene's expression profile as determined by the correlation coefficient. Since the model profiles were selected independent of the data, the algorithm can then determine which profiles have a statistically significant higher numberthan genes assigned using a permutation test. This test determines an assignment of genes to model profiles using a large number of permutations of the time points. It then uses standard hypothesis testing to determine which model profiles have significantly more genes assigned under the true ordering of time points compared to the average number assigned to the model profile in the permutation runs. Significant model profiles can either be analyzed independently, or grouped together based on similarity to form clusters of significant profiles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-Ramoni1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-Miller2">[29]</xref>.</p>
<p>STC-GO supports Gene Ontology enrichment analyses for sets of genes having the same significant temporal expression pattern. We select random samples of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0011377.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0011377.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the number of genes assigned to the same model temporal expression profile r.) genes at each iteration and compute Fisher's exact test p-values for the selected genes in all GO biological categories <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-Ashburner1">[30]</xref>. The two-sided Fisher's exact test p-value for a category reflects a test of the null hypothesis that the category is enriched in genes assigned to profile r with respect to what would have been expected by chance alone. To decide whether or not to follow up a category that appears enriched in these genes, we would know the statistical reliability of the apparent enrichment. To assess the significance of a particular category, we need to know the distribution of p-values that would occur by random chance. The percentage of false positives to be tolerated will generally depend on the relative costs of false positives and false negatives in whatever follow-up study is to be done. This way of framing the question leads us to specify the false discovery rate (FDR) for a set of categories, rather than significance level (p-value) for each category. With the significance at the 0.05 level, for a given category, the enrichment <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0011377.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is given by <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0011377.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> where <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0011377.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the number of genes assigned to profile r within the GO category of interest, m is the total number of genes within the GO category of interest, and N is total number of unique genes in the gene reference database list.</p>

<p>After N-PRRSV infection, the affected pigs exhibited the following clinical symptoms within 3–7 days: fever of 40.08–40.8°C, depression, anorexia, rough hair coats, dyspnoea, reddening of skin, oedema of the eyelids, conjunctivitis, mild diarrhoea, shivering. Those UNC pigs did not show any obvious changes in body temperature and clinical signs. QPCR assay showed that N-PRRSV virus was present in each of the 6 infected pigs. But N-PRRSV NSP2 gene was not differentially expressed at 96 h pi and 168 h pi (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0011377.s011">Table S1</xref>). Histopathology examination of N-PRRSV-affected pigs showed interstitial pneumonia in lungs with thickening of alveolar septa accompanied with infiltration of immune cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011377-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Most viral antigen was detected in alveolar cells and bronchiolar epithelial cells in lesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011377-g001">Figure 1C</xref>).</p>

<title>Analysis of DGE libraries</title>
<p>To investigate the regulation of the host response to the N-PRRSV virus, we considered the global gene expression profiles in lungs using Solexa/Illumina's DGE system, a tag-based transcriptome sequencing method. We sequenced three porcine lung DGE libraries from C, N96, N168 using massively parallel sequencing on the Illumina platform. Major characteristics of these three libraries were summarized <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0011377-t001">Table 1</xref>. We obtained approximately 6.9 million total sequence tags per library with 515885 distinct tag sequences. Prior to mapping these tag sequences to reference sequences, we filtered adaptor tags, low quality tags and tags of copy number  = 1, producing approximately 6.6 million total clean sequence tags per library with 179589 distinct clean tag sequences. The C library had the highest number of both total sequence tags and distinct sequence tags; this was followed by the N168, N96 libraries. Moreover, the C library had the highest ratio of number of distinct tags to total tags and the lowest percentage of distinct clean high copy number tags. The data showed that more genes were detected in the C library than other two libraries and more transcripts were expressed at lower levels in the C library. Saturation analysis of capacity of libraries showed that new emerging distinct tags were gradually reduced with increasing of total sequence tags when the number of sequencing tags was big enough. When the number of sequencing tags reached 3 million, library capacity approached saturation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0011377.s001">Figure S1</xref>).</p>

<title>Analysis of tag mapping</title>
<p>For tag mapping, we preprocessed one reference tag database that included 51670 sequences from <italic>sus scrofa</italic> Unigene. To get the reference tags, we used NlaIII to digest all the samples and took all the CATG+17 tags in the gene as the gene's reference tags, not only the 3′ most one. We obtained 194664 total reference tag sequences with 172119 unambigous tag sequences. Considering polymorphism across samples, tolerances were set to allow one mismatch in each alignment. By the criteria, 47.71%∼51.04% of distinct clean tags mapped to the Unigene virtual tag database, 39.42%∼42.11% of the distinct clean tags mapped unambiguously to the Unigene, and 52.29%∼48.96% of the distinct clean tags didn't map to the Unigene virtual tag database (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0011377-t001">Table 1</xref>). The occurrence of unknown tags was probably due to the incompleteness of pig genome sequencing. Most Solexa experimental tags matched to the 1st or 2nd 3′ CATG site in high-confidence transcripts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0011377.s002">Figure S2</xref>). For solexa sequencing can distinguish between transcripts originating from both DNA strands, employing the strand-specific nature of the sequencing tags obtained, we found evidence for bidirectional transcription in 6368 to 8271 of all detectable Unigen clusters and 3889 to 4043 antisense-stand specific transcripts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0011377.s012">Table S2</xref>). By comparison, the ratio of sense to antisense strand of the transcripts was approximately 1.7∶1 for all libraries. This suggests that in spite of the high number of antisense mapping events detected, the transcriptional regulation in the N-PRRSV-induced immune response acts most strongly on the sense strand. To analyze the depth of transcriptome sampling in the DGE libraries, we studied the rate of increase of the number of genes (sense+antisense strand) identified as the size of the corresponding library increases. When the library size reached one million, we could identify 45% and 30% all genes and genes identified by unambigous tags, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0011377.s003">Figure S3</xref>). At this time, library capacity approached saturation.</p>

<title>Identification of differentially expressed (DE) genes and signaling pathway analysis</title>
<p>To gain the global transcriptional changes in N-PRRSV infected porcine lungs, we applied the method described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-Audic1">[27]</xref> to identify DE genes from the normalized DGE data by pairwise comparisons between all differential time points (N96/C, N168/C, N168/N96) during infection. Results showed that 5430 genes had p values &lt;0.005, false discovery rate (FDR) &lt;0.01 and estimated absolute log2-fold change &gt;0.5 in at least one of the pairwise comparisons, which were declared to be differentially expressed during infection course (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0011377.s013">Table S3</xref>).</p>
<p>To characterize the functional consequences of gene expression changes associated with infection with N-PRRSV, we performed pathway analysis of DE genes based on the KEGG database by two-side Fisher's exact test. We chose only significant pathway categories that had a P-value of &lt;0.05 and an FDR of &lt;0.05. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0011377.s004">Figure S4</xref>, the significant signaling pathways include cell adhesion molecules (CAMs), T cell receptor signaling pathway, antigen processing and presentation, Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis, etc (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0011377.s014">Table S4</xref>).</p>

<title>Validation of DGE data by qPCR</title>
<p>To validate DE genes identified by Solexa sequencing, we selected 8 genes for qPCR confirmation.

Data were presented as fold changes in gene expression normalized to the HPRT1 gene and relative to the C sample. Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) showed that both the DGE and qPCR data (pooling samples) were highly correlated, for the genes modulated by N-PRRSV had a high consistency and r values ranging from 0.781 (CYP3A88) to 0.997 (AECC) between the two methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011377-g002">Figure 2</xref>). qPCR analysis (both pooling samples and independent RNA extractions from biological replicates) confirmed the direction of change detected by DGE analysis.

<title>Identification of DE genes in known pig Quantitative trait loci (QTL) regions associated with health traits</title>

In the present paper, we mapped the DE genes to pig QTL regions of health traits in pig QTLdatabase (PigQTLdb).

<title>STC and STC-GO analysis</title>
<p>In order to profile gene expression time series and search for the most probable set of clusters generating the observed time series, we used STC algorithm of gene expression dynamics, which explicitly took into account the dynamic nature of temporal gene expression profiles during clustering and identified the number of distinct clusters. By STC, DE genes exhibited 8 types of temporal expression pattern (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0011377.s006">Figure S6</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0011377.s013">Table S3</xref>) with 4 (profile 1,6,0,7) significant cluster profiles which have significantly more genes assigned under the true ordering of time points compared to the average number assigned to the model profile in the permutation runs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0011377.s006">Figure S6</xref>).

<p>The most prominently overrepresented GO terms of significant cluster profile 1 (0,−1,−1) and profile 0 (0,−1,−2), which are down-regulated genes, involved in regulation of lipid, cholesterol biosynthetic and metabolic process; regulation of skeletal muscle development, muscle cell differentiation; digestion; negative regulation of neuron apoptosis and neurological system process (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0011377.s016">Table S6</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0011377.s007">Figures S7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0011377.s008">S8</xref>).

<p>Lipid rafts, lipid microdomains of the cell membrane enriched in sphingolipids, cholesterol and associated proteins, play critical roles in the life cycle of many viruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-Li2">[35]</xref>. Some viruses enhance their replication by modulating host cell lipid metabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-Syed1">[36]</xref>. DGE analysis of pigs infected with N-PRRSV showed significant increase of transcript abundance in many genes involved in lipid metabolism, including those for apolipoprotein B48 receptor (APOB48R), apolipoprotein-E (APOE), low density lipoprotein B (LDLB), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase catalytic subunit type 3 (PIK3C3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011377-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Perhaps N-PRRSV alters hosts' lipid metabolism to create a lipid-rich intracellular environment to facilitate its own multiplication. Moreover, we also observed that N-PRRSV induced upregulation expression of anti-apoptotic genes in N-PRRSV infected lungs, including myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (BCL2-related) (MCL1), nuclear factor kappa-B 1 (NFKB1), NFKB2, adrenomedullin (ADM), and interleukin 10 (IL10), and downregulation expression of pro-apoptotic genes, including Bak protein (BAK), (apoptosis-related protein 1) (APR1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011377-g003">Figure 3D</xref>) to inhibit apoptosis, which might prolong cell life and increase the yield of progeny virions.</p>

<p>Viral infection results in an inflammatory response, which is an essential component of the antiviral innate immune response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-Anderson1">[41]</xref>. After recognizing the PAMPs, either surface or intracellular PRRs trigger intracellular signaling cascades that results in the activation of transcription factors, including nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), interferon-regulatory factors (IRFs), and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STATs). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011377-g004">Figure 4A</xref>, transcripts of the Toll-like PRRs TLR1, TLR2, TLR4, TLR6, were significantly increased in N-PRRSV-infected pigs at days 4 through 7 pi, but no change in TLR3 which specializes in the recognition of viral dsRNA was detected. Cytoplasmic PRRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011377-g005">Figure 5A</xref>), retinoic-acid-inducible protein I (RIG-I, DDX58) and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5), the two most relevant for defense against viruses, were expressed at a high level after N-PRRSV infection.

<title>Relationship between pulmonary gene expression profiles and N-PRRSV infection pathology</title>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Infection of pigs with N-PRRSV caused fever, dyspnoea, reddening of skin, oedema of the eyelids, conjunctivitis, depression, anorexia, mild diarrhoea. Histopathology examination showed interstitial pneumonia in lungs with thickening of alveolar septa accompanied with infiltration of immune cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-Drew1">[46]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011377-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Although great efforts have been made by many researchers, the molecular basis of N-PRRSV infection is largely unknown. Here we report on the first genome-wide host transcriptional response to N-PRRSV infection using Solexa/Illumina's digital gene expression (DGE) system, a tag-based novel high-throughput transcriptome deep sequencing method. Given the nature of the methodology of Illumina's DGE system, we have pooled biological replicates from three pigs for each group to make representative samples for deep sequencing analysis. We could reach a sequencing depth of 6.3–7.9 million tags per library (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0011377-t001">Table 1</xref>) and found over 5000 genes to be differentially expressed during N-PRRSV infection processes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0011377.s013">Table S3</xref>). Although others studies have also pooled biological replicates for library construction and deep sequencing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-Hegedus1">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-Glazov1">[48]</xref>, resulting in the lack of biological replicate, one may blur the impact of variations in pooling samples. Because of the variations of pigs in response to PRRSV infection, it is possible that one pig could significantly affect results without independent libraries. But we performed the qPCR validation both on the same pooled material that was used for deep sequencing and on independent RNA extractions from each pig, which all confirmed the direction of change detected by DGE analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011377-g002">Figure 2</xref>).</p>
<p>Our DGE analysis showed massive changes in the transcript abundace of known immune response genes and of genes that have been implicated in PRRSV infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-Zhang1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-Genini1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-Miller1">[20]</xref>. We also identified many interesting genes that had not been linked to PRRSV infection in previous studies. For example, transcript abundace of lipid metabolism-related genes including APOB48R, APOE, PIK3C, was significantly increased during N-PRRSV infection processes. Alterations in lipid metabolism, perhaps including those with significant upregulation in this study, have been observed in response to infection by a range of viruses including SARS-CoV, HCV, influenza A virus, or dengue virus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-Li2">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-Syed1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-Barman1">[49]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-CeballosOlvera1">[50]</xref>. Although <italic>In vitro</italic> studies have investigated how PRRSV modifying genes expression in PAMs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-Zhang1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-Genini1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-Miller1">[20]</xref>, many of the outstanding issues will be answered only in the context of PRRSV-infected animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-Perlman1">[51]</xref>. Hence, we characterized the genome-wide transcriptome response to PRRSV infection in porcine lung by deeping sequencing. But studies of transcript abundance in lung tissues have also their intrinsic limitations. For example, the transcriptome of lung tissues is actually a merging transcriptional responses of a wide range of cell types, some of which are infected, some of which are responding directly to the infectious process and others of which are bystanders. Moreover, increased cellularity of tissues may be confused as biologically important increased transcript abundance. Despite such limitations, our DGE study offers a broad, system-wide window into molecular processes that regulate gene expression and also provides new leads for functional studies of candidate genes involved in host-virus interaction, as illustrated in this paper.</p>
<p>The induction of expression of type I interferons (IFNs; including IFN-α and IFN-β) is a well-known innate antiviral immune reaction in the virus-infected cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-Sadler1">[52]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-Fensterl1">[53]</xref>. However, N-PRRSV infection suppressed SPI IFN gene expression and decreased the transcript abundance of IFN-α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011377-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-Genini1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-Buddaert1">[54]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-VanReeth1">[55]</xref>, both in vitro and in vivo, have also showed that PRRSV elicited only a minimal IFN-α production or even suppressed it's expression. The suppression of SPI IFN, in particular of IFN-α, is probably a crucial step in the pathogenesis, because IFN-α has been shown to inhibit PRRSV replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-Kimman1">[11]</xref>. Other viruses infection, such as the 1918 influenza virus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-Kobasa1">[56]</xref>, hepatitis C virus (HCV) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-Lau1">[57]</xref>, Ebola virus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-Kash1">[58]</xref>, also suppressed type I IFN gene expression which led to extensive viral replication and increased pathogenesis. IRF3 plays an important role for type I IFN gene expression. The transcript abundance of IRF3 was decreased intensively in N-PRRSV-infected pigs by 168 h pi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011377-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). One study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-Beura1">[59]</xref> indicated that PRRSV NSP1β inhibited IRF3, and then down-regulated IFN-β gene expression. It is worth mentioning that the NSP1 of the influenza A can also suppress innate immunity by inhibiting IRF3 activation, and subsequently disrupting the induction of α/β–interferon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-Mibayashi1">[60]</xref>. Research has indicated that the expression of CD163, a PRRSV receptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-Calvert1">[61]</xref>, on macrophages in different microenvironments, <italic>in vivo</italic>, may determine the replication efficiency and subsequent pathogenecity of PRRSV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-Patton1">[62]</xref>. Transcript abundance of CD163 was significantly increased after N-PRRSV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011377-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). The internalization of PRRSV via CD163 in the target cells may induce the expression of IL10, and in turn induce the expression of CD163 on neighboring undifferentiated monocytes and increased overall PRRSV susceptibility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-Patton1">[62]</xref>.</p>
<p>Moreover, infected pigs develop a strong and rapid humoral response but these initial antibodies do not confer protection and can even be harmful by mediating an ADE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-Mateu1">[12]</xref>. These antibodies enhance PRRSV viral replication by coating the virus and enhancing the internalization of viral particles into macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-Mateu1">[12]</xref>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011377-g005">Figure 5G and 5H</xref>, IgG and Fcγ receptors were significantly induced during N-PRRSV infection processes. Interestingly, the presence of antibodies during feline enteric coronaviruses (FECVs) infection does not also provide sterilizing immunity, instead, these antibodies opsonize virus particles and facilitate their entry to monocytes and/or macrophages through Fcγ receptors, resulting in disease enhancement <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-Perlman1">[51]</xref>.</p>
<p>The activation of pro-inflammatory transcription factor NF-κB induces robust activation of the CASP1 inflammasome and subsequent release of IL-1β that cause fever and inflammation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-Dinarello1">[63]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-Dinarello2">[64]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-Ting1">[65]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-Mariathasan1">[66]</xref>. Accordingly, we identified upregulation expression of CASP1, NF-κB, and IL-1β genes during N-PRRSV infection processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011377-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). NF-κB activation also enhanced the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP2) and MMP9, two cytotoxic substances in PRRSV-infected cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-Kimman1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-Girard1">[67]</xref>. Similarly, transcript abundance of MMP2 and NGAL (25 kDa alpha-2-microglobulin-related subunit of MMP-9) was significantly increased in the lungs of N-PRRSV-infected pigs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011377-g005">Figure 5F</xref>). Upregulation expression of MMPs would likely facilitate infiltration of inflammatory cells and increase inflammation.</p>
<p>Upregulation expression of IL8 (also known as CXCL8), which is an attractant for neutrophils and other polymorphonuclear leukocytes produced after acute infection, in PRRSV-infected PAMs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-Thanawongnuwech1">[68]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-AitAli1">[69]</xref> and lungs of N-PRRSV-infected pigs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011377-g005">Figure 5D</xref>), was observed. Other chemokines such as CCL2 (also known as MCP1 ), CXCL9, CXCL10 (also known as IP10), which were significantly increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011377-g005">Figure 5D</xref>), may be also crucial for lymphocyte and macrophage infiltration into the sites of N-PRRSV infection. CCL2, IL8 and IP10 expression were upregulated during SARS-CoV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-Tsui1">[70]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-Frieman1">[71]</xref>, and murine coronavirus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-Liu1">[72]</xref> infections process, which may recruit monocytes and/or macrophages to sites of infection and be a major cause of lung pathology. Although the present study indicates that upregulation expression of pro-inflammatory molecules contributes to the pathogenesis of N-PRRSV, increased transcript abundance of anti-inflammatory molecules, such as IL10, PGE2, was also detected in the study. Upregulation of IL10 gene expression was found previously in PRRSV-infected porcine leukocytes, PAMs, DCs, and <italic>in vivo</italic> in PRRSV infected pigs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-Suradhat1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-Suradhat2">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-Genini1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-FloresMendoza1">[73]</xref>. Perhaps an increase in pro-inflammatory molecules followed by increased anti-inflammatory molecules is the normal progression of events in inflammation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-Hossain1">[74]</xref>. The upregulation expression of IL10 might skew the immune response away from a protective Th1-cell response towards a non-protective Th2-cell response, therefore impairing clearance of virus, which benefits viral infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-Perlman1">[51]</xref>. Upregulation expression of anti-inflammatory molecules and pro-inflammatory molecules occurring concurrently was also observed after SARS-CoV and FIPV infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-Lee1">[75]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-Dean1">[76]</xref>. Antibodies might also contribute to immunopathogenesis through increasing the uptake of virus by macrophages, resulting in activation of these macrophages and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Antigen-antibody complexes might increase transcript abundance of complement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011377-g005">Figure 5I</xref>), which leads to generation of the classical inflammatory response through the production of potent proinflammatory molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-Dunkelberger1">[77]</xref>. Furthermore, complement activation might also contribute to the development of pulmonary edema and oedema of the eyelids. Further understanding the roles complement plays in the host-pathogen interactions may help to develop more effective pharmacological agents against infection. Moreover, damage to the lungs of N-PRRSV-infected pigs seems to occur directly by viral destruction of alveolar and bronchial epithelial cells and macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011377-g001">Figure 1C</xref>), as well as indirectly through production of immune mediators.</p>
<p>Activated CTLs and NK cells release perforin (PFR) and granzymes, which two effectors act collaboratively to induce apoptosis of target cells. Transcript abundance of PFR1 and granzymes increased in the lungs of N-PRRSV infected pigs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011377-g006">Figure 6H</xref>). Pro-apoptotic molecules XAF1, BID, cyto c, CASP10, AIFM2, were significantly up-regulated after infection with N-PRRSV, which may induce apoptosis of virus-infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011377-g006">Figure 6I</xref>). Simultaneously, we also observed upregulation expression of anti-apoptotic genes in N-PRRSV infected lungs, including BCL2A1, MCL1, CHFR, NFKB, ADM, IL10 etc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011377-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). Upregulation expression of anti-apoptotic genes and pro-apoptotic genes occurring concurrently after N-PRRSV infection seems in contradiction of each other. However, this may reflect a balance between apoptotic and anti-apoptotic mechanisms. Perhaps PRRSV actively induces an anti-apoptotic state to complete its virus replication cycle through delaying cell death while induces apoptosis of virus-infected cells after completion of virus replication to increase rate of spread of virus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-Genini1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-Mi1">[78]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-Bowie2">[79]</xref>. Anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic activaties were also observed in PRRSV-infected Marc-145 cells, in which PRRSV stimulated anti-apoptotic pathways early in infection while caused apoptosis of PRRSV-infected cells late in infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-Costers2">[80]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-Lee2">[81]</xref>. Infection with N-PRRSV also increased transcript abundance of NFKBIA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011377-g006">Figure 6I</xref>), an inhibitor of the TNF receptor activated transcription factor NF-κB. Loss of NF-κB activity has been shown to increase the cytotoxic effects of TNF which resulted in increased cell death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-Kash2">[82]</xref>. An increase of transcript abundance in pro-apoptotic genes might result in disruption of the mitochondria transmembrane potential, thereby inducing release of cyto c from mitochondrial membranes to induce apoptosis and secondary necrosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-Green1">[83]</xref>.</p>
<p>The production of ROS, especially superoxide radicals, and the subsequent oxidative damage of cells and tissues are recognized as key contributors to the viral pathogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-Kash2">[82]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-Akaike1">[84]</xref>. ROS-mediated oxidative stress might also be involved in inducing apoptosis by PRRSV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-Lee2">[81]</xref>. Accordingly, we identified the remarkable upregulation of cytochrome b245 heavy chain (GP91-PHOX) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011377-g006">Figure 6J</xref>), a critical component of the membrane-bound oxidase of phagocytes (macrophages and neutrophils), after infection with N-PRRSV, that generated superoxide radicals that killed both infected and normal cells at sites of infection, which would further exacerbate the immunopathological response.</p>
<p>Infection of macrophages, monocytes and DCs that are essential for immune function, is likely to be a key component in N-PRRSV-induced pathogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-Genini1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-Delputte1">[85]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-Loving1">[86]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-Wang1">[87]</xref>. Apoptosis of infected cells causes immune suppression by two mechanism: apoptosis either induces a decrease in the numbers of immune cells that compromises both the innate and adaptive immune response in which they are unable to eradicate the primary infection, or impairs immunity by inducing immunosuppressive effects in the surviving cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-Hotchkiss1">[88]</xref>. For example, uptake of apoptotic cells by normal macrophages and DCs stimulates immune tolerance by inducing the release of anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL10, and suppressing the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011377-Albert1">[89]</xref>. Histopathological analysis of the lymphnodes of pigs infection with N-PRRSV revealed a profound depletion of immune cells compared with those of UNC (data not shown).</p>
<p>In summary, the data presented in this study suggest that N-PRRSV appears to utilize multiple strategies for its replication and spread in infected pigs, including subverting host innate immune response, inducing an anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory state as well as developing ADE. After infection of macrophages and possibly DCs, PRR-PAMP interactions triggered signaling cascades that increased the transcript abundance of multiple inflammatory molecules, including cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules and inflammatory enzymes that induce a pro-inflammatory response, activate and recruit immune cells, such as macrophages and neutrophils, to sites of infection for virus elimination and thereby produce the clinical symptoms of viral infection, such as fever, dyspnoea, interstitial pneumonia in lungs. Further, antibodies and complement activation might exacerbate inflammatory response. N-PRRSV might induce an immunosuppressive state, mediated by apoptosis of infected cells, which caused depletion of immune cells and induced an anti-inflammatory cytokine response in which they were unable to eradicate the primary infection.</p>
