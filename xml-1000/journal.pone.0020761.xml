        <p>Gene expression is highly dynamic and many genes show a wide range in expression over several orders of magnitude. This regulation is often mediated by sequence specific transcription factors. In addition, the tight packaging of DNA into chromatin can provide an additional layer of control resulting in a dynamic range of gene expression covering several orders of magnitude. During transcriptional activation, chromatin barriers have to be eliminated to allow an efficient progression of the RNA polymerase. This repressive chromatin structure has to be re-established quickly after it has been activated in order to tightly regulate gene activity. We show that the DExD/H box containing RNA helicase Rm62 is targeted to a site of rapid induction of transcription where it is responsible for an increased degree of methylation at H3K9 at the heat shock locus after removal of the heat shock stimulus. The RNA helicase interacts with the well-characterized histone methyltransferase SU(VAR)3-9 via its N-terminus, which provides a potential mechanism for the targeting of H3K9 methylation to highly regulated genes. The recruitment of SU(VAR)3-9 through interaction with a RNA helicase to a site of active transcription might be a general mechanism that allows an efficient silencing of highly regulated genes thereby enabling a cell to fine tune its gene activity over a wide range.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Gene expression is regulated at the level of initiation, elongation and termination of transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020761-Sims1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020761-Saunders1">[2]</xref>. In order to modulate the expression of a given gene, basal as well as sequence specific transcription factors cooperate to facilitate the recruitment of the RNA polymerase to a given promoter and regulate its activity. Besides the mere DNA sequence of the regulatory regions, the wrapping of DNA into chromatin heavily influences the level to which a particular gene is transcribed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020761-Workman1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020761-Li1">[4]</xref>. The degree of chromatin packaging can be modulated by histone modifying enzymes that generate a specific modification pattern thereby marking active and inactive genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020761-Liu1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020761-Guttman1">[6]</xref>. Although the modification patterns can allow a distinction between genes that are permanently silenced and those that are actively transcribed, it is unclear how genes that can cycle between a highly active and an inactive state are marked. Such genes often respond to an external signal such as a hormone or intracellular stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020761-Simon1">[7]</xref>. The signal is usually perceived by a specific transcription factor that associates with a promoter via binding to a specific DNA element in the regulatory region of the gene. Along with the transcription factor, multiple transcriptional co-activators are recruited that can either facilitate the binding of the basal transcriptional machinery, modify histones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020761-Adelman1">[8]</xref>, remodel nucleosomes or displace nucleosomes from the whole genomic locus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020761-Petesch1">[9]</xref>. When the signal ceases, nucleosomes reform at the locus and the repressed state is reconstituted. Although there is some controversy of whether or not the formation of a nucleosomal structure is a cause or a consequence of repression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020761-Bryant1">[10]</xref> there is a clear correlation between the two events <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020761-Schwabish1">[11]</xref>.</p>
      <p>One of the best-characterized promoters that can rapidly switch between an active and an inactive state controls the transcription of the <italic>hsp70</italic> gene. The promoter of the <italic>hsp70</italic> gene adopts a well defined chromatin structure that is hypersensitive towards DNaseI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020761-Costlow1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020761-Wu1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020761-Weber1">[14]</xref> and has TBP bound <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020761-Giardina1">[15]</xref>. This specific promoter architecture leads to a recruitment of RNA polymerase II even in absence of the stimulus and the generation of a paused polymerase that requires a stimulus to be released from the pre-initiation complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020761-Rougvie1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020761-Gilmour1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020761-Li2">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020761-Gilmour2">[19]</xref>. A heat shock pulse then leads to a cooperative binding of the sequence specific transcription factor HSF1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020761-Xiao1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020761-Zimarino1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020761-Wu2">[22]</xref> to the <italic>hsp70</italic> promoter, which in turn results in promoter clearance of RNA polymerase II and the subsequent accumulation of <italic>hsp70</italic> RNA. The heat shock pulse also leads to a recruitment of histone modifying enzymes such as the H3K4 methyltransferase PAF1, which results in an increase of H3 methylated at K4 over the whole body of the gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020761-Adelman1">[8]</xref> and histone chaperones such as FACT that facilitate nucleosome disassembly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020761-Saunders2">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020761-Andrulis1">[24]</xref>. As a consequence the nucleosomes get disrupted over a large region of the <italic>hsp70</italic> locus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020761-Petesch1">[9]</xref> allowing transcription to occur at a high level. This process of histone removal is dependent on the poly ADP ribosyltransferase (PARP) and is independent of processive transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020761-Petesch1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020761-Tulin1">[25]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Despite this large body of knowledge with regards to <italic>hsp70</italic> activation, little is known about the mechanisms that re-establish the repressed state at this highly inducible gene. Transcriptionally inactive genes are frequently marked by a methylation of H3 at position K9. This modification is catalyzed by H3K9 specific methyltransferases such as SU(VAR)3-9 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020761-Rea1">[26]</xref>, G9a <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020761-Tachibana1">[27]</xref> or SETDB1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020761-Schultz1">[28]</xref>. Although this modification localizes predominantly to pericentric heterochromatin, H3K9 methylation has also been detected at euchromatic regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020761-Fanti1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020761-Cryderman1">[30]</xref> and has been suggested to be important for transcriptional activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020761-Lu1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020761-Vakoc1">[32]</xref>. However, the activating function of H3K9me seems to be an exception from the rule as targeted methylation of H3K9 to ectopic sites lead to the generation of silenced chromatin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020761-Ayyanathan1">[33]</xref>. Currently one of the best-characterized histone methyltranseferases is SU(VAR)3-9 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020761-Rea1">[26]</xref>. It has been initially identified by a genetic screen for factors that affect heterochromatin formation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020761-Reuter1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020761-Aagaard1">[35]</xref> and has been subsequently identified in many higher eukaryotes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020761-Schotta1">[36]</xref>. All SU(VAR)3-9 orthologoues have a conserved domain structure containing a chromo domain at the N-terminus and a catalytically active C-terminal SET domain. Besides the catalytically active SET domain, the region that resides N-terminal of the chromo-domain of SU(VAR)3-9 also plays an important role in modulating SU(VAR)3-9s methyltransferase activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020761-Ebert1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020761-Eskeland1">[38]</xref>. We therefore analyzed proteins that interact with the SU(VAR)3-9 N-terminus in order to find potential regulators of SU(VAR)3-9 and understand the mechanism of how SU(VAR)3-9 exerts its function in eu- as well as in heterochromatin. One of the proteins we have identified as interactor with the N-terminal tail of SU(VAR)3-9 is the DExD/H containing RNA-helicase Rm62. Rm62 plays a role in multiple gene regulatory processes such as alternative splicing RNA release and subsequent export <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020761-Buszczak1">[39]</xref>, steroid receptor mediated activation of transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020761-Watanabe1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020761-Clark1">[41]</xref> and RNAi mediated silencing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020761-Ishizuka1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020761-Csink1">[43]</xref>. We show that Rm62 interacts with SU(VAR)3-9 N-terminal region <italic>in vitro</italic> as well as <italic>in vivo</italic>. As Rm62 has been reported as a mediator of <italic>hsp70</italic> transcriptional shut down, we also investigated the function of SU(VAR)3-9 in this process and find a similar role like Rm62. We observe an increase in H3K9 methylation during transcriptional shut down on the heat shock loci on polytene chromosomes that is dependent on the presence of Rm62 suggesting a functional role of the RNA helicase on recruiting a methyltransferase.</p>

        <p><italic>Drosophila</italic> wildtype and <italic>Rm62</italic> mutant (<italic>CBO2119/LIP-F</italic>) larvae were grown in standard food media. Approximately 200–300 mg of well-fed third instar larvae was used for each reaction. Larvae were heat shock treated at 37°C for 45 min and were sacrificed immediately. For the recovery after heat shock, larvae were further cultured in normal temp (25°C) for another three hours. All larvae were resuspended in 5 ml of buffer A1 (60 mM KCl, 15 mM NaCl, 4 mM MgCl2, 15 mM HEPES (pH7.6), 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5 mM DTT, 10 mM sodium butyrate, EDTA-free complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) and crosslinked with 1.8% formaldehyde at room temperature. To stop the cross linking reaction, 2.5 M glycine was added to a final concentration of 225 mM, mixed thoroughly and further incubated for 5 min on ice. The cross-linked larvae ware resuspended in 2.5 ml of lysis buffer (140 mM NaCl, 15 mM HEPES pH 7.6, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mM DTT, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.05% SDS, 10 mM sodium butyrate, EDTA-free complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) 0.1% SDS and 0.5% N-lauroylsarcosine and incubated for 10 min at 4°C. Chromatin was sheared in a Bioruptor (Diagenode) to achieve chromatin fragments of an average length from 300–500 bp. The sonicated chromatin was diluted with ChIP dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton-X100, 1.2 mM EDTA, 16.7 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.1, 167 mM NaCl, 1× EDTA free protease inhibitors cocktail (Roche)) and pre-cleared with Protein A agarose/salmon sperm DNA beads (Millipore) for 1 hour at 4°C. About 200 µg of precleared chromatin was incubated with 25 µl of anti-Rm62 (1E7), anti-H3K9me2 (Upstate 07-212) and anti-SU(VAR)3-9 (SU3D9) overnight prior to the addition of a protein A Sepharose beads. Immunoprecipitated complexes were washed sequentially with low salt buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X100, 2 mM EDTA, 20 mM Tris-HCl pH8.1, 150 mM NaCl), high salt buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton –X100, 2 mM EDTA, 20 mM Tris-HCl pH8.1, 500 mM NaCl), LiCl wash buffer (0.25 M LiCl, 1% NP-40, 1% Desoxycholate, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH8.1) and 10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA pH8 (2 times). The bound DNA was eluted with elution buffer (1% SDS, 0.1 M Na<sub>2</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub>) and cross links removed for 6 hrs at 65°C. After treatment with RNase A (Sigma) and Proteinase K (Sigma), DNA was purified with Nucleospin Extract II DNA purification columns according to manufacturer's instructions (Macharey Nagel).

Among other proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020761-Boeke2">[47]</xref>, we have identified the DExD/H box containing RNA helicase Rm62 as a specific interactor with SU(VAR)3-9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020761-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). In order to confirm the interaction <italic>in vivo</italic> we generated specific monoclonal antibodies recognizing Rm62 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020761-g001">Figure 1C</xref>) and used it to immunoprecipitate a putative Rm62 complex. As the concentration of endogenous SU(VAR)3-9 are so low that the protein is difficult to detect, we performed the immunoprecipitation in a cell line that expressed HA-tagged SU(VAR)3-9 under a copper inducible promoter. In this experiment we could detect SU(VAR)3-9 co-immunoprecipitating with Rm62 using a Rm62 specific antibody but not with a control antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020761-g001">Figure 1D</xref>).

As expected from the pull down experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020761-g001">Figure 1B</xref>, N-terminal truncations of SU(VAR)3-9 abolished its interaction with immobilized recombinant GST-Rm62 protein whereas C-terminal truncations can still interact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020761-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). This direct interaction is mediated by the first 141 amino acids of Rm62, which do not contain the helicase domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020761-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). The same domain is also responsible for the dimerisation of Rm62 suggesting that it may be an important region for regulating this protein-protein interaction. However, a more detailed analysis would be required to determine the molecular function of this region of Rm62.</p>

        <title>SU(VAR)3-9 and Rm62 regulate <italic>hsp70</italic> transcriptional shutdown</title>
        <p>As we see an interaction between Rm62 and SU(VAR)3-9 we wondered whether they may also regulate similar genes. Rm62 has been shown to be involved is the shut down of the <italic>hsp70</italic> gene after heat shock. Therefore, we subjected SL2 cells to a 30 minute heat shock at 37°C and determined the relative levels of hsp70 RNA after recovery from heat shock by quantitative RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020761-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). In accordance to what has been shown before <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020761-Buszczak1">[39]</xref> we see a significant delay in the transcriptional shut down of <italic>hsp70</italic> transcription in cells where Rm62 has been removed by RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020761-g003">Figures 3A</xref>, bottom panel and B). When we knock down Su(var)3-9 transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020761-g003">Figure 3A</xref>, top panel), we observe a similar effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020761-g003">Figure 3B</xref>) suggesting that SU(VAR)3-9 also has a role in re-silencing the <italic>hsp70</italic> gene. The increased <italic>hsp70</italic> transcription is not due to an increased heat shock response, as we do not detect significant changes in the amount of <italic>hsp70</italic> RNA immediately after heat shock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020761-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). We next wondered whether we would see the same effect of Rm62 and SU(VAR)3-9 on hsp70 transcription in Drosophila larvae. To do this, we analyzed the recovery of hsp70 transcription from heat shock in flies that carry a mutation in <italic>Rm62</italic> or <italic>Su(var)3-9</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020761-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). Similar to what we see in SL2 cells, we also observe an increased <italic>hsp70</italic> transcription after 3 hrs of recovery in the mutant flies when compared to wildtype. In the mutant flies we find an increased <italic>hsp70</italic> expression even before heat shock, suggesting that the prolonged lack of SU(VAR)3-9 or Rm62 leads to a relaxed chromatin structure of the normally tightly regulated <italic>hsp70</italic> locus in the corresponding mutant fly strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020761-g003">Figure 3C</xref>).</p>

            <p>(<bold>A</bold>) RNAi against SU(VAR)3-9 and/or Rm62 specifically eliminates the respective proteins as well as it's mRNA from SL2 whole cell extract (WCE). SL2 cells were transfected with specific double stranded RNAs against SU(VAR)3-9, Rm62 or GST (control). WCEs and total RNA were prepared 6 days after transfection. <italic>Left</italic>: Proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by western blotting with the indicated antibodies (GST: control RNAi, SU(VAR)3-9: RNAi against Su(var)3-9, Rm62: RNAi against Rm62, SU(VAR)3-9/Rm62: double knockdown of Su(var)3-9 and Rm62). <italic>Right</italic>: 1 µg oft total RNA, was reverse transcribed (Superscript™, Reverse Transcriptase, Invitrogen) using gene specific primers for Su(var)3-9 or Rm62, respectively. 10% of the obtained cDNA were analyzed by standard PCR using specific primers for Su(var)3-9 or Rm62, and separated by agarose gel electrophoresis. To discriminate between genomic and cDNA, we used intron spanning primer pairs in the PCR reaction. (<bold>B</bold>) Quantitative RT-PCR of the <italic>hsp70 m</italic>RNA from SL2 cells before (no HS), after heat shock (30 min HS) and a 180 min of recovery phase (+180 min recovery). SL2 cells, cultured under standard conditions, were subjected to RNAi against GST (control), Su(var)3-9 or Rm62. After 6 days of culturing, cells were either not treated (no HS) or treated with a heat shock (30 min HS) followed by a recovery for 180 min at 26°C (+180 min recovery), respectively. RNA from these cells was isolated, reverse transcribed and analyzed by quantitative real time PCR. Bars represent relative <italic>hsp70</italic> RNA expression levels (in percent) normalized to an internal control (U6 snRNA), which does not respond to heat shock. Percent expression was calculated to the maximal amount of RNA measured after heat shock. The inlet graph shows an enlargement of the calculated values after 180 min recovery upon heat shock. The observed difference between the SU(VAR)3-9/GST and Rm62/GST is significant as calculated with an unpaired two sided Student's t-test (p = 0.041 and p = 0.014, respectively). Error bars indicate the standard deviation of two replicates.

RNAs were extracted from the flies either not treated or treated with a heat impulse and “recovered” for 120 min at 25°C and further subjected to quantitative real time PCR. Bars represent relative <italic>hsp70</italic> RNA expression levels (in percent) normalized to an internal control (18S rRNA), which has a minimal effect on heat shock. The observed difference between Su(var)3-9 mutant and Rm62 mutants compared to wildtype flies is significant as calculated with an unpaired two sided Student's t-test (p = 0.047 and p = 0.003, respectively).

        <p>We next wanted to know if Rm62 is indeed recruited to the <italic>hsp70</italic> gene <italic>in vivo</italic> and if this recruitment is required for the methylation of H3K9 following re-silencing. To do this, we incubated third instar larvae of wildtype or mutant flies for 45 minutes at 37°C. This heat shock resulted in puffing of the three heat shock loci 87A, 87C and 93C. Concomitantly with the heat shock Rm62 is recruited to the heat shock loci and slowly dissociates from the locus during recovery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020761-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Consistent with the hypothesis that Rm62 recruits a H3K9 methyltransferase we observe a re-establishment of the H3K9me2 signal when <italic>hsp70</italic> transcription ceases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020761-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). The kinetics of H3K9me2 re-appearance are much slower than the recruitment of Rm62, which could either reflect the dynamics of histone molecules after heat shock or the presence of a demethylase immediately after heat shock. In flies that carry a null mutation of Rm62 (lipF) and fail to fully shut down <italic>hsp70</italic> transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020761-Buszczak1">[39]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020761-g003">Figure 3C</xref>), the histones that reassemble on the heat shock loci have a lower degree of H3K9 methylation suggesting that Rm62 is indeed responsible for the targeting of a H3K9 specific methyltransferase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020761-g004">Figure 4B</xref>, right panel). In order to get a better picture of the recruitment of Rm62 and SU(VAR)3-9 to the <italic>hsp</italic>70 locus, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitations of the <italic>hsp70</italic> promoter region using antibodies against Rm62, SU(VAR)3-9 and H3K9me2 in wildtype or Rm62 mutant flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020761-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Comparable to what we observe in polytene chromosomes, Rm62 is recruited to the <italic>hsp70</italic> promoter immediately after heat shock and is no longer crosslinked to the promoter after a 3 hr recovery phase. Likewise, SU(VAR)3-9's binding to the promoter is substantially increased after heat shock. The recruitment of SU(VAR)3-9 is dependent on the presence of Rm62 as the binding is decreased in the Rm62 mutant flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020761-g005">Figure 5</xref>, dark bars). In the absence of any heat shock and after the promoter recovered from heat shock the histones carry a methylation at H3K9, which is dependent on the presence of Rm62 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020761-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Interestingly, despite a clear enrichment of the methylating enzyme, H3K9me2 is reduced at the <italic>hsp70</italic> promoter immediately after heat shock wildtype flies, which is likely due to the complete removal of histones after heat shock <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020761-Petesch1">[9]</xref>.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We have identified Rm62 as an interactor with the N-terminus of SU(VAR)3-9. Interestingly, this interaction domain is shared between the SU(VAR)3-9 and eIF2γ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020761-Krauss1">[48]</xref> and could therefore mediate the interaction between Rm62 and both proteins. We focused our studies on the analysis of the nuclear interaction of Rm62 and SU(VAR)3-9 as it seems to be important for the efficient shut down of highly activated genes such the <italic>hsp70</italic>. In accordance with the previously described role of histone modifications at the heat shock locus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020761-Adelman1">[8]</xref>, we observe a strong H3K9 methylation at the <italic>hsp70</italic> gene before heat shock activation, which disappears after heat shock and slowly reappears when cells recover from heat shock. This methylation is highly dependent on the presence of Rm62 as it is strongly reduced in <italic>Rm62</italic> mutant fly strains. Rm62 mutation not only leads to less H3K9 methylation at the heat shock loci but also leads to a global reduction of the H3K9me2 mark in euchromatin. This suggests a widespread mechanism of methyltransferase recruitment mediated by the interaction between Rm62 and SU(VAR)3-9.</p>

        <title>Histone modifications regulate gene activation and repression at the <italic>hsp70</italic> locus</title>
        <p>Histone modifications play a crucial role in regulating gene expression. The <italic>hsp70</italic> locus provides an excellent model promoter for rapidly switching between the on and the off state of transcription and it has been shown to be regulated at multiple levels including histone modification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020761-Adelman1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020761-Boehm1">[49]</xref>. One of the factors that get recruited to the heat shock promoter immediately after activation is the Rm62, which we identified as an interactor with the histone methyltransferase SU(VAR)3-9. Despite being recruited immediately after heat shock, Rm62 plays a role in transcriptional shut down after removal of the heat shock <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020761-Buszczak1">[39]</xref>. It has been suggested that the RNA helicase activity is required for the efficient removal of the RNA from its site of transcription, which in turn is important for the resilencing of the gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020761-Buszczak1">[39]</xref>. However, a more direct role in the generation of the repressed state could not be excluded. As we observe a strong, Rm62 dependent, recruitment of SU(VAR)3-9 to the promoter after heat shock, which is important for the reestablishment of H3K9 methylated chromatin, we propose that the interaction between the two proteins contributes to the regeneration of a repressive chromatin structure after heat shock. Buszczak and colleagues observe a prolonged phosphorylation of H3S10 at the <italic>hsp70</italic> locus in flies that carry a mutation in Rm62 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020761-Buszczak1">[39]</xref>, which may very well be due to a failure of recruiting SU(VAR)3-9 and H3K9 methylation in absence of Rm62. The phosphorylation of H3S10 is severely impaired when the neighboring residue (H3K9) is methylated by SU(VAR)3-9 <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020761-Rea1">[26]</xref> and <italic>in vivo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020761-Deng1">[50]</xref>. The recruitment of a H3K9 methyltransferase to the <italic>hsp70</italic> gene after heat shock may therefore prevent an efficient phosphorylation of H3S10 thereby favoring the reestablishment of a repressed chromatin structure. At the same time could the increased recruitment of a H3S10 kinase prevent a premature methylation of K9 via the recruited methyltransferases, which may explain the striking kinetic difference we observe between the binding of SU(VAR)3-9 and the accumulation of H3K9 methylated histones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020761-g004">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020761-g005">5</xref>). Our findings may therefore provide another example of a phospho-methyl switch <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020761-Fischle1">[51]</xref> where a strong interdependence of histone methylation and histone phosphorylation on adjacent residues is observed. Alternatively, the lack of histone methylation after heat shock that is seen by immunofluorescence and by ChIP could be due to the fact that histones are completely removed after heat shock and are only reassembled during recovery. In this case the recruitment of SU(VAR)3-9 would lead to an increased local concentration of the methyltransferase at the site of the promoter, which could (re-)methylate the ejected histones leading to the regeneration of a repressed state after heat shock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020761-g007">Figure 7</xref>). This may in fact also explain the seemingly paradoxical effect of HP1 localisation at heat shock puffs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020761-Piacentini1">[45]</xref>. The binding data could also suggest that the recruitment of SU(VAR)3-9 is in fact important for gene activation as we find it to bind to the promoter immediately after the induction of transcription. However, we think this is unlikely as we only observe an effect of SU(VAR)3-9 and Rm62 removal on the shut down of <italic>hsp</italic>70 transcription but not on it's induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020761-g003">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

            <p>(<bold>A</bold>) Under non-heat shock conditions the <italic>hsp70</italic> gene is silenced, but a paused PolII (pPolII) is bound to the promoter and small, kryptic RNAs originate from the transcription start site. (<bold>B</bold>) <italic>Early heat shock response:</italic> upon heat shock, heat shock factor 1 (HSF) is recruited to the <italic>hsp70</italic> promoter, resulting in PolII promoter release and conversion of paused to elongating Pol II (ePolII), leading to the massive generation of <italic>hsp70</italic> RNA. On the chromatin level this state is characterised by histone methylation (H3K4) and subsequent histone depletion. We find that the heat shock also leads to a recruitment of Rm62 and SU(VAR)3-9 to the <italic>hsp70</italic> locus in a RM62 dependent manner. <italic>Late heat shock response:</italic> when the heat shock trigger ceases, reassembling histones get methylated by SU(VAR)3-9 that is already bound. As a consequence of chromatin reassembly, transcription re-initiation and <italic>hsp70-</italic>RNA production are strongly diminished. (<bold>C</bold>) The chromatin state in the <italic>recovery</italic> or <italic>refractory</italic> phase is characterised by a high level of H3K9 methylation and a complete silencing of <italic>hsp70</italic> transcription. SU(VAR)3-9 and Rm62 are released and the gene locus which is prone for another activation cycle.</p>

        <title>The role of RNA in <italic>hsp70</italic> regulation</title>
        <p>An alternative explanation for the apparent discrepancy between SU(VAR)3-9 binding and H3K9 methylation could be the need for an additional signal for the enzyme to become active. Such a signal could be an external signal such as a posttranslational modification or an internal signal such as the RNA transcribed from the <italic>hsp70</italic> locus itself. Immediately after heat shock a short burst of small RNAs can be detected that are released from the heat shock locus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020761-Rasmussen1">[52]</xref>. Considering the fact that Rm62 also plays a role in RNAi mediated silencing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020761-Csink1">[43]</xref>, this pulse of small RNAs might in fact be the cause for the heat shock dependent recruitment of Rm62 to the <italic>hsp70</italic> locus that we observe. Our data suggest that SU(VAR)3-9 is then recruited to the hsp70 locus via protein-protein interactions where it methylates the histones that are assembled onto the promoter during repression. However, we have not tested the possibility that the RNA stimulates the activity of SU(VAR)3-9, which could also contribute to the delayed histone methylation.</p>
        <p>Finally we cannot exclude that, in addition to SU(VAR)3-9, a demethylase is recruited to the <italic>hsp70</italic> locus, which removes the histone methylation from the promoter bound histones. Indeed, the jmjC family member dUTX, which contains a H3K27 specific demthylase associates with the elongating RNA polII enzyme and is recruited to the <italic>hsp70</italic> locus after heat shock <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020761-Smith1">[53]</xref>. It is very likely that multiple redundant mechanisms play a role in the re-silencing of the <italic>hsp70</italic> genes after heat shock with all the possibilities discussed above being involved. In light of our novel finding of a functional interaction between SU(VAR)3-9 and Rm62 it will be interesting to investigate whether this interaction my also provide a mechanistic link between the shut down of highly active genes and the silencing of repetitive DNA elements via the generation of short non translated transcripts that may help in recruiting a histone methyltransferase. Similar mechanisms have been shown to operate in <italic>S. pombe</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020761-Buhler1">[54]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020761-Chen1">[55]</xref> but were so far not identified in higher eukaryotes.</p>
