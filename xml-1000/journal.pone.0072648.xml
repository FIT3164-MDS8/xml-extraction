<abstract>
<p>Adenosine plays an important role in regulating intestinal motility and inflammatory processes. Previous studies in rodent models have demonstrated that adenosine metabolism and signalling are altered during chronic intestinal inflammatory diseases. However, the involvement of the adenosinergic system in the pathophysiology of gut dysmotility associated to a primary neurodysfunction is still unclear. Recently, we showed that the neurotropic <italic>Herpes simplex</italic> virus type-1 (HSV-1), orally inoculated to rodents, infects the rat enteric nervous system (ENS) and affects gut motor function without signs of systemic infection. In this study we examined whether changes in purinergic metabolism and signaling occur during permanent HSV-1 infection of rat ENS. Using isolated organ bath assays, we found that contraction mediated by adenosine engagement of A<sub>1</sub> or A<sub>2A</sub> receptors was impaired at 1 and 6 weeks post-viral administration. Immunofluorescence studies revealed that viral infection of ENS led to a marked redistribution of adenosine receptors: A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2B</sub> receptors were confined to the muscle layers whereas A<sub>2A</sub> and A<sub>3</sub> receptors were expressed mainly in the myenteric plexus. Viral-induced ENS neurodysfunction influenced adenosine metabolism by increasing adenosine deaminase and CD73 levels in longitudinal muscle-myenteric plexus with no sign of frank inflammation. This study provides the first evidence for involvement of the adenosinergic system during HSV-1 infection of the ENS. As such, this may represent a valid therapeutic target for modulating gut contractility associated to a primary neurodysfunction.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Gastrointestinal neuromuscular diseases (GINMD), including chronic idiopathic intestinal pseudo-obstruction and irritable bowel syndrome, are a clinically heterogeneous group of diseases presumed to result from morpho-functional alterations of the enteric nervous system (ENS), in the absence of evident structural or biochemical abnormalities. These disorders are characterized by motor impairments and abnormal visceral perception and secretion, with high morbidity and occasional fatal outcome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072648-DiNardo1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072648-DeGiorgio1">[2]</xref>. Infectious agents, such as neurotropic viruses, have been suggested as etiologic factors involved in ENS disruption <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072648-Gershon1">[3]</xref>. However, there is only scarce evidence proving a direct causative role of these viruses in functional bowel disorders; these are based on reports of disease onset in patients after a viral infection, or on detection of viral genomes in the ENS of seriously ill patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072648-DeGiorgio2">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072648-DeGiorgio3">[5]</xref>.</p>
<p>Among several neurotropic viruses <italic>Herpes simplex</italic> virus type 1 (HSV-1) is a pathogen which merits consideration as a potential etiologic factor of GINMD. Indeed, HSV-1 has the ability to remain latent in host neurons for life. Reactivation from the latent state results in productive HSV-1 infection that ultimately leads to the lytic destruction of distal epithelial cells. During latency HSV-1 resides in neurons by producing only non-coding viral transcripts, collectively known as latency associated transcripts (LATs). HSV-1 replication involves the expression of viral genes in a tightly regulated, ordered cascade which begins with production of immediate-early genes Î± (e.g. infected cell proteins, ICP0, ICP4, ICP22, and ICP27) responsible for regulating viral gene expression during subsequent phases of the replication cycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072648-Roizman1">[6]</xref>. Gesser et al. (1994, 1995, 1996) showed that in mice HSV-1 orally inoculated was able to establish latency in the nodose ganglia of the vagus nerve or spread through the myenteric, submucosal, and periglandular plexuses leading to progressive inflammatory disease and death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072648-Gesser1">[7]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072648-Gesser3">[9]</xref>. HSV-1 shedding from the oropharyngeal mucosa occurs in chronically infected human subjects thus facilitating virus passage to the gastrointestinal tract mucosa where it infects the nodose and celiac ganglia.</p>
<p>Our research group has established a novel animal model of persistent HSV-1 infection in the ENS, using a protocol characterized by an intranasal low viral inoculum to create a latent HSV-1 infection in the central nervous system, followed after four weeks by an intragastric viral administration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072648-Brun1">[11]</xref>. In this model latent HSV-1 persists in the ENS for several weeks after oral challenge, which leads to gut motor abnormalities in the absence of frank inflammation. So far, the mechanism(s) through which primary defects in ENS are responsible for bowel dysfunction, including motor abnormalities, remains poorly understood. Our animal model displays several interesting features which can be capitalized upon to address such basic biological questions.</p>
<p>Adenosine plays a prominent role in intestinal functions, modulating the complex interplay between ENS, smooth muscle and epithelial barrier function in physiological and pathological conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072648-Antonioli1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072648-Kolachala1">[13]</xref>. Adenosine exerts its biological actions through G-protein-coupled receptor subtypes designated as A<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>2A</sub>, A<sub>2B</sub> and A<sub>3</sub>, each with distinct affinities for adenosine and distribution and function in the gut. Under normal conditions, adenosine concentration is dependent on processes such as intracellular and extracellular biosynthesis, cellular release, re-uptake and metabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072648-Giron1">[14]</xref>. However, under adverse conditions, such as hypoxia or inflammation, production of extracellular adenosine rises dramatically and the nucleoside appears to have a pivotal role in neuromuscular function and in the prevention of inflammatory responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072648-Antonioli1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072648-Kolachala1">[13]</xref>. Besides its recognized role in regulating inflammatory responses, adenosine appears to be involved in viral infection. Inhibition of the A<sub>1</sub> receptor (A<sub>1</sub>R) pathway suppresses HSV-1 replication, whereas increased activity of ecto-5â²nucleotidase (CD73) may be a potential evasion strategy developed by the <italic>Herpesviridae</italic> cytomegalovirus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072648-Kan1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072648-KasDeelen1">[16]</xref>. Little is known, however, about possible involvement of the adenosinergic system in the pathophysiology of gut dysmotility associated with a primary neurodysfunction. The animal model we have developed is unique when placed alongside the large body of existing data on gastrointestinal neurodysfunction, in which ENS damage arises from chemically- or parasite infection-induced mucosal inflammation and not from primarily affected myenteric ganglia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072648-DeMan1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072648-Aul1">[18]</xref>. The present study was therefore designed to investigate whether in rat ileum adenosine metabolism and signaling are affected during HSV-1 infection of ENS, in terms of contractile responses to adenosine and distribution of its receptor subtypes and metabolic enzymes, namely adenosine deaminase (ADA) and CD73.</p>

<title>Animals, viral Inoculation and Infection</title>
<p>HSV-1 strain 16 propagation was carried out as previously described on Vero cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072648-Brun1">[11]</xref>. HSV-1 inoculation in male Wistar rats (350â450 g body weight; Harlan, Italy) was performed by a two-step infection protocol, consisting of an initial intranasal (IN) instillation followed four weeks later by an intragastric inoculum. Animals were first anesthetized with tiletamineâzolazepam (20 mg/kg intramuscular; Zoletil, Virbac, Italy) and xylazine (5 mg/kg intramuscular; Bayer S.p.A., Italy). HSV-1 intranasal administration (10<sup>3</sup> plaque forming units, pfu in 20 Âµl phosphate buffered saline, PBS) was performed using a micropipette to drop virus solution onto rat external nares. After four weeks, intranasally infected rats were administered 10<sup>8</sup> pfu HSV-1 via intragastric gavage using a 24-gauge, 9-cm catheter. Before and after treatments all animals had free access to standard laboratory chow and tap water and were housed, three in a cage, in temperature-controlled rooms on a 12-h light cycle at 22â24Â°C and 50â60% humidity, and were observed daily for signs of disease. At either 1 or 6 weeks post-intragastric inoculation, rats were killed by decapitation. Control animals were injected with equal volumes of Vero cell lysate (sham infection) and killed at matching time points. No histological and functional changes were observed between time-matched sham animals which were thus considered as a single control group, designated as sham group. All experimental protocols were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Padova, and were in compliance with the national and European guidelines for handling and use of experimental animals.</p>

<title>Histology, Inflammatory Cytokine Analysis and Myeloperoxidase Activity</title>
<p>Specimens of distal ileum (5â10 cm from ileocecal valve) were fixed in 10% buffered formalin for 24 h, and then embedded in paraffin. Sections (5-Âµm-thick) were stained with haematoxylin &amp; eosin. Slides (nâ=â3 rat for each experimental group) were assessed by a observer blinded to the treatment groups. Ileal segments were homogenized in ice-cold 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, containing 0.5% hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide to prevent the pseudoperoxidase activity of haemoglobin and to solubilise membrane-bound myeloperoxidase (MPO). Homogenates were centrifuged 10,000 g (10 min at 4Â°C) and MPO activity was measured by colorimetric assay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072648-Brun1">[11]</xref>. All samples were examined within 2 days of collection. Segments of small intestine were collected from sham or infected animals and the longitudinal muscle myenteric plexus (LMMP) homogenized in PBS (1â¶10 wt/vol) supplemented with protease inhibitors (1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 Âµg/mL aprotinin, 10 Âµg/mL leupeptin). After centrifugation (10,000 Ã <italic>g</italic> for 10 min at 4Â°C), interleukin-2 (IL-2), interferon-Î³ (IFN-Î³), and tumor necrosis factor-Î± (TNF-Î±) were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Biosource, Milan, Italy).

<title>RNA Extraction and Quantitative Real-time PCR for viral Genes</title>
<p>The SV total RNA isolation system (Promega) was used to extract total RNA from isolated myenteric ganglia according to the manufacturerâs protocol. Myenteric ganglia were homogenized in lysis buffer and contaminating DNA was removed by DNase I treatment (Promega). Total RNA (3 Âµg) was reverse transcribed to cDNA using random primers and MuLV reverse transcriptase (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). To study the HSV-1 replication cycle, 5 ÂµL of the reverse-transcription reactions were subjected to real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) using primers for immediate early gene (infected cell protein, ICP4) and latency associated transcripts (LATs). qPCR was performed on an ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection System (Perkin Elmer, Norwalk, CT) using SYBR Green (Applied Biosystems). The primer-dimers formation for each oligonucleotide set was ruled out by generating melt-curve profiles. For each sample, the amounts of the targets and endogenous reference (glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, GADPH) were extrapolated from a standard curve prepared using serially-diluted correspondent cDNAs subcloned into the pGEM-T vector (Promega).

<p>In basal conditions concentration-response curves (100 ÂµM - 1.25 mM) for adenosine were constructed by cumulative addition of the nucleoside. Responses were expressed as gram tension/gram dry tissue weight of ileal segments. Adenosine-evoked concentration-response curves (plotted against log of adenosine concentration) were subjected to a non-linear regression analysis (fitted to a sigmoidal equation) to calculate EC<sub>50</sub> and Emax values. Contractile effects of adenosine (1 mM) were investigated in the presence or absence of atropine (1 ÂµM) or tetrodotoxin (1 ÂµM, TTX; Tocris Bioscience, Bristol, UK) or DPCPX (0.01 ÂµM), an A<sub>1</sub> purinoceptor antagonist, or ZM 241385 (0.01 ÂµM), an A<sub>2A</sub> purinoceptor antagonist, which remained in contact with the tissue for 20 min before repeating the adenosine curve.

<title>Assessment of HSV-1 Infection of ENS</title>
<p>Six weeks post HSV-1 intragastric inoculum HSV-1 TK DNA was still detectable in myenteric ganglia, although viral DNA copy number was reduced as compared to the first week after intragastric administration (data not shown). To define the nature of HSV-1 infection in the ENS, qPCR analysis of HSV-1 mRNA transcripts in the myenteric ganglia of sham and infected rats was performed. Expression of viral LATs was detected in isolated myenteric ganglia at 1 and 6 weeks after intragastric inoculation, whereas mRNA transcripts of the viral immediate early ICP4 gene were present only at 1 week post-viral inoculum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0072648-g001">Figure 1</xref>). During the viral infection time-course no signs of illness were detected in infected rats. A preserved ileal architecture, together with no changes in ileal MPO activity confirmed the absence of inflammatory damage in HSV-1 infected animals (data not shown).

In physiological conditions, adenosine (100 ÂµMâ1.25 mM) produced a contraction that persisted throughout the contact time, reaching a maximum of 21.6âÂ±â1.4 g tension/g dry tissue weight at 1.25 mM, with an EC<sub>50</sub> of 0.62 mM (95% CL 0.54â0.71 mM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0072648-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). A significant downward shift of the concentration-response curves to adenosine and a consequent significant decrease in Emax values occurred in HSV-1 infected rats 1 and 6 weeks (EC<sub>50</sub>â=â0.62 mM, 95% CL 0.55â0.69 mM and Emaxâ=â17.6Â±0.9 g tension/g dry tissue weight; EC<sub>50</sub>â=â0.65 mM, 95% CL 0.47â0.91 mM and Emaxâ=â12.5Â±1.8 g tension/g dry tissue weight, respectively) post HSV-1 intragastric administration compared with sham animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0072648-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). The direct responses to post-junctional receptor activation by exogenous adenosine were evaluated in the presence of atropine (a muscarinic receptor antagonist) or TTX (a potent neuronal voltage-gated Na+ channels). In sham rats, pre-treatment with atropine or TTX significantly reduced adenosine-mediated contraction (â33 and â38%, respectively), indicating that contraction induced by adenosine is partially dependent on acetylcholine release from enteric cholinergic nerves through preferential activation of prejunctional adenosine receptors in the rat myenteric plexus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0072648-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). In contrast to sham ileum, pre-treatment with atropine or TTX failed to affect adenosine-induced contraction during HSV-1 infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0072648-g003">Figure 3B</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The involvement of adenosine pathways in the pathophysiology of gastrointestinal dysmotility associated with ENS dysfunction, although known, is represented by data which are both limited, and sometimes conflicting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072648-Antonioli1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072648-Kolachala1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072648-Bornstein1">[20]</xref>. The present study was carried out to determine the effect of a viral infection of the ENS on contractile responses to adenosine, as well as on distribution of adenosine receptors and of its enzymes CD73 and ADA in rat ileum. Our results show that: (i) under normal conditions, exogenous adenosine contracts longitudinal smooth muscle of intact rat ileum; (ii) in the presence of HSV-1 infection in the ENS, adenosine-mediated contractile response by A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2A</sub> receptors is impaired at 1 and 6 weeks post-infection; (iii) latent HSV-1 infection in neurons influences the distribution of CD73, ADA and adenosine receptors in a distinct manner in ileal smooth muscle layers and myenteric plexus.</p>
<p>Since HSV-1 infection in the ENS determines ileal dysmotility due to impaired cholinergic neurotransmission, we decided to evaluate adenosineâs effect on spontaneous basal contractility and not on pre-contracted preparations. This was done to avoid any influence of the underlying anomalous cholinergic transmission induced during HSV-1 infection of ENS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072648-Brun1">[11]</xref>. Exogenous adenosine or related analogues influence cholinergic and tachykininergic transmission, thus impacting on intestinal motility, peristaltic reflex, transit and secretion in the small and large intestines of rodents <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072648-Antonioli1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072648-Kolachala1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072648-Bornstein1">[20]</xref>. In spite of a large body of published studies, the physiological function of adenosine remains to be fully clarified. This is an important point, considering that adenosine-mediated effects have been mainly studied on intestinal preparations pre-contracted with a muscarinic agonist or with electric field stimulation-evoked acetylcholine release rather than on ileal spontaneous basal tone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072648-DeMan1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072648-Antonioli2">[21]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072648-Zizzo1">[24]</xref>. Moreover, difficulties in dissecting adenosine-mediated responses arise from concurrent activation of different adenosine receptor subtypes, each leading to opposing (i.e. contraction or relaxation), time- and concentration-dependent responses. Thus, stimulation of high-affinity A<sub>1</sub> receptors appears to be responsible for purinergic modulation on cholinergic and tachykininergic transmission, whereas A<sub>2A</sub> receptors may either reduce cholinergic motor responses or facilitate acetylcholine release in rodents <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072648-Antonioli1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072648-Kolachala1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072648-Zizzo2">[25]</xref>. Low-affinity A<sub>2B</sub> and A<sub>3</sub> receptors exert inhibitory control by regulating nitric oxide release or by negatively controlling cholinergic activity, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072648-Antonioli2">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072648-Zizzo3">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072648-Chandrasekharan1">[27]</xref>.

In our preparations we observed an increase of ileal basal tone induced by exogenous adenosine. This effect, being partially prevented by atropine or TTX, appears to be mediated by adenosine stimulation via P1 receptors of myenteric muscle cells and of nerve endings, thus influencing excitatory neurotransmission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072648-Nicholls1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072648-Zizzo3">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072648-Nicholls2">[29]</xref>. To investigate the receptor(s) responsible for adenosine excitatory effects in physiological condition, ileal segments were exposed to adenosine in the presence or absence of A<sub>1</sub>R or A<sub>2A</sub>R agonists and antagonists. Differential responses to A<sub>1</sub>R and A<sub>2A</sub>R agonists in the presence of atropine or TTX supports the notion that these two adenosine receptors mediate ileal contraction through different mechanisms: A<sub>1</sub>R activity directly influences smooth muscle contractility whereas A<sub>2A</sub>R modulates cholinergic transmission in myenteric neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072648-DuarteArajo1">[30]</xref>. In particular, nanomolar concentrations of the selective A<sub>1</sub>R antagonist DPCPX, applied to ileal preparations enhanced adenosine-evoked contractions of longitudinal smooth muscle whereas the A<sub>2A</sub>R antagonist ZM241385 reduced the amplitude of adenosine responses. These observations support an opposite regulatory action for the two receptor subtypes in ileal contractile activity under physiological conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072648-Zizzo3">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072648-Murthy1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072648-DuarteArajo1">[30]</xref>.</p>
<p>In our animal model the presence of HSV-1 in the ENS provoked a mild inflammatory reaction, as evidenced by changes in levels of inflammatory cytokines during the course of infection and in absence of any tissue damage. Given adenosineâs important role in the complex crosstalk between enteric neurons and smooth muscle cells and the fine tuning of intestinal motor and inflammatory responses, this model may find utility in undercovering the role of adenosine where motility disturbances of ENS origin are present. The increased amplitude of spontaneous phasic contractions in infected animals confirms our previous observations that HSV-1-induced latent infection of ENS causes an underlying anomalous neuromuscular transmission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072648-Brun1">[11]</xref>. However, adenosine was still able to induce reproducible and concentration-dependent contraction of ileal segments from infected rats, with a significant reduction in maximal response. Adenosine itself possesses potent anti-inflammatory properties, and is up-regulated in several models of gastrointestinal disorders such as infection induced by the parasite <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072648-Antonioli1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072648-Kolachala1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072648-DeMan1">[17]</xref>. The responses obtained by adenosine treatment or by direct activation of A<sub>1</sub> or A<sub>2A</sub> receptor subtypes in ileal preparations were affected over the HSV-1 infection time-course. Impaired neuronal acetylcholine release during HSV-1 infection implied a loss of A<sub>2A</sub>R-mediated effects mainly at the level of prejunctional facilitatory receptors. On the other hand, A<sub>1</sub>R-mediated effects were still affected by the presence of HSV-1 in a noticeable, albeit minor way, since they are mainly located on the smooth muscle layer and insensitive to atropine or TTX blockade <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072648-DeMan1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072648-Antonioli3">[22]</xref>.</p>
<p>The biological actions of adenosine are mediated by four G-protein-coupled receptor subtypes differentially expressed throughout the gastrointestinal tract, and depend on animal species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072648-Antonioli1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072648-Coupar1">[31]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072648-Vieira1">[34]</xref>. We thus asked whether HSV-1 infection affected their distribution in the smooth muscle layers and in myenteric plexus. Following HSV-1 infection of ENS, A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2B</sub> receptor subtypes undergo a marked up-regulation, particularly at the muscle layer level whereas A<sub>2A</sub>R and A<sub>3</sub>R show a marked increase of immunoreactivity in myenteric ganglia and longitudinal muscle layer. Previous studies have focused on unmasking the role of a single adenosine receptor subtype in pathological conditions. As far as we know, the effect of an intestinal insult on the distribution of all four receptor subtypes has not been considered until now. Our observations are in line with past reports describing a reduced inhibitory control of A<sub>1</sub>R associated with enhanced expression of A<sub>2A</sub>R in the neuromuscular compartment, and of A<sub>3</sub>R in the myenteric plexus of rats with DNBS-induced colitis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072648-Antonioli2">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072648-Antonioli3">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072648-Antonioli4">[35]</xref>. Increased expression of A<sub>2B</sub>R has been reported in inflamed colonic epithelium from humans and mice but not in smooth muscle layers, as we found in our ileal preparation from infected rats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072648-Kolachala2">[36]</xref>. Collectively, our findings support the view that, either during inflammation or infection, the distribution of P1 receptors is affected in both myenteric ganglia and muscular layers, confirming their active role in the pathophysiology of GINMD.</p>
<p>Recent evidence indicates that the ecto-enzymes CD73 and ADA represent synergistic checkpoints for regulating adenosine availability to preserve tissue integrity during insult <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072648-Antonioli1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072648-Giron1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072648-Colgan1">[37]</xref>. Is their distribution affected during HSV-1 latent infection in ENS? We and others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072648-Giron1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072648-Nitahara1">[38]</xref> have shown CD73 expression in the myenteric plexus and smooth muscle cells of normal ileum, where this ecto-5â²nucleotidase mediates the formation of adenosine from AMP. On the other hand, ADA is predominantly localized in the mucosal layer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072648-Antonioli5">[39]</xref>. CD73 immunoreactivity was localized to smooth muscle layers of normal rat ileum, becoming elevated both in myenteric plexus and longitudinal smooth muscle layer at week 6 following viral intragastric inoculum. This increase likely supports CD73 action in regulating endogenous adenosine levels, thereby allowing the latterâs receptors to exert anti-inflammatory actions or, eventually, facilitate viral evasion during chronic infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072648-Colgan2">[40]</xref>. In line with these findings, we found also an enhanced expression of ADA initially restricted at myenteric plexus during the acute phase of infection (at 1 week) but as the infection becomes chronic (at 6 weeks) this enzyme extends toward the longitudinal smooth muscle layer. An increase of extracellular adenosine levels during adverse conditions has been shown to be associated with higher ADA expression, presumably to avoid possible deleterious effects of long-term adenosine exposure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072648-Antonioli5">[39]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072648-Eltzschig1">[41]</xref>. Conceivably, in the presence of inflammation or other harmful stimuli adenosine levels could be fine-tuned to create discrete microenvironments, termed âpurinomesâ, within the enteric neuromuscular layer by means of nucleoside production/inactivation involving CD73 and ADA, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072648-Antonioli2">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072648-DuarteArajo1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072648-CorreiadeS1">[42]</xref>. This would ensure the correct functioning of specific receptor subtypes under different pathophysiological conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072648-Schwiebert1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072648-Volont1">[44]</xref>.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the findings described here demonstrate that adenosine acts as an excitatory modulator of the contractility of rat ileal longitudinal smooth muscle by stimulating P1 purinoceptors on myenteric neurons and ileal smooth muscle cells. Latent HSV-1 infection in ENS affects adenosine-mediated modulation of the complex crosstalk between enteric neurons and smooth muscle cells, as evidenced by the molecular and functional rearrangement of adenosine receptors and related metabolic enzymes. These observations, together with a growing body of knowledge linking the adenosinergic system to modulation of immune/inflammatory processes can provide a foundation for detecting and understanding digestive motor dysfunctions. Ultimately, this will lead to the development of novel pharmacological tools for the diagnosis and therapeutic management of enteric dysmotility.</p>
