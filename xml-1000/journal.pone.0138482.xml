<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a complex, heterogeneous disease [<xref rid="pone.0138482.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. To understand and predict these complexities, there has been great efforts to identify biomarkers that correlate with disease severity. One of the proposed biomarker for COPD is plasma vitamin D level. However, previous studies have shown inconsistent results regarding the role of vitamin D in lung function [<xref rid="pone.0138482.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], COPD development [<xref rid="pone.0138482.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138482.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], exacerbation [<xref rid="pone.0138482.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0138482.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], comorbidities [<xref rid="pone.0138482.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and mortality [<xref rid="pone.0138482.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Vitamin D is synthesized in the skin after sunlight exposure, but level of vitamin D can be influenced by food intake and several regulatory mechanisms, such as parathyroid hormone (PTH). The purpose of our study is to identify the biomarkers that reflect disease severity of COPD including lung function and quality of life by using data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES).</p>

<title>Study design and participants</title>
<p>This study used data from KNHANES, a cross-sectional, nationally representative population-based health and nutritional surveys by the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention since 1998. Participants were selected using proportional allocation systematic sampling with multistage stratification, and the sampling units were based on geographical area, age, and sex. This survey includes a health interview, a health examination, and nutritional questionnaires. Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) were performed for subjects &gt;40 years of age. COPD was defined as a PFT result of FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC &lt;0.7 among adults aged over 40 years of age according to the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines [<xref rid="pone.0138482.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Data from a total of 10269 adults &gt;40 years of age were retrieved from KNHANES, and among them, population of 1302 patients who met the definition of COPD were included for further analysis. All the individuals in this surveillance participated voluntarily, and provided written informed consent. The survey protocol was approved by the institutional review board of the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec008">
<title>Measurements of variables</title>
<p>Spirometry was performed using standardized equipment (model 1022 Spirometer; SensorMedics, California, USA) according to guidelines from the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society [<xref rid="pone.0138482.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Spirometry was repeated at least three times to ensure validity and reproducibility. The PFT results were analyzed based on the reference values from predictive equations for Korean populations [<xref rid="pone.0138482.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], and reviewed by trained physicians. As this study was part of a national survey, post-bronchodilator testing was not performed, and all measurements were based on pre-bronchodilator values. Blood samples were collected in serum separator tubes. Plasma was separated by centrifugation and stored at -70°C. Total serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) level was measured using radioimmunoassay kits (Diasorin, Stillwater, MN, USA), and expressed in ng/mL (conversion factor, 2.5 for nmol/L). Plasma PTH was measured by N-tact PTH assay using the LIAISON (Diasorin, Stillwater, MN, USA) chemiluminescence immunoassay method, and expressed in pg/mL. Other parameters such as white blood cell (WBC) count, hemoglobin (Hb), platelets, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine (Cr) were analyzed in a central, certified laboratory.</p>
<p>Questionnaires used for data collection by KNHANES included scale-based assessments for health-related quality of life (QOL). Health-related QOL was measured using the validated Korean version of the 5-item self-administered EuroQOL instrument (EQ-5D). The EQ-5D is a generic questionnaire used to assess the QOL in patients with chronic disease [<xref rid="pone.0138482.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In previous studies, good correlations between EQ5D-index and SGRQ score [<xref rid="pone.0138482.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138482.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and between SGRQ score and CAT score were reported [<xref rid="pone.0138482.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The EQ-5D has a descriptive system and a visual analogue scale (VAS), and reports patients’ current health status. The descriptive assessment consists of 5 items: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each item can be used to represent profiles of health status or can be converted to a summary index (EQ5D index). The VAS is a measurement scale ranging from 0 (worst health status) to 100 (best health status).</p>

<title>Definition</title>
<p>Degree of airflow limitation was classified based on value of FEV<sub>1</sub> (% predicted), and GOLD stage 1, 2, 3, and 4 COPD was defined if FEV<sub>1</sub> &gt; 80%; 50% &lt; FEV<sub>1</sub> ≤ 80%; 30% &lt; FEV<sub>1</sub> ≤ 50%; FEV<sub>1</sub> ≤ 30%, respectively [<xref rid="pone.0138482.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Vitamin D insufficiency was defined as a 25-OHD concentration of ≤ 15 ng/mL. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated using Cockcroft-Gault equation of [(140 − age) × (body weight)]/(serum Cr × 72), with a factor of 0.85 applied for women [<xref rid="pone.0138482.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Chronic kidney disease was defined when patients reported history of kidney disease or an eGFR of &lt;60 ml/min.</p>

<sec id="sec010">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Data were analyzed via complex-sample analysis procedures using SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). We adjusted the analysis for the complex sample design of the survey using stratification, sampling weight variables, and clustering variables for prevalence production. In order to compare characteristics of each subgroup, general linear regression was used for continuous variables and logistic regression was used for categorical variables. To determine the association between lung function and values of biomarkers such as vitamin D and PTH in COPD patients, general linear regressions was conducted with age, sex, height, body mass index (BMI), current smoking status, and kidney disease as variables. With respect to the association between QOL and the values of vitamin D and PTH in COPD patients, adjustment were made for age, sex, BMI, current smoking status, COPD severity, diabetes, hypertension, and kidney disease. Comparisons of QOL according to quartile of biomarker levels were analyzed using analysis of covariance adjusted by same variables. A <italic>P</italic>-value &lt; 0.05 was used to indicate statistical significance.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 1302 patients met the definition of COPD in data of KNHANES. Among them, 43.5% were GOLD 1 (FEV<sub>1</sub> ≥ 80%), 51.4% were GOLD 2 (50% ≤ FEV<sub>1</sub> &lt; 80%), 4.4% were GOLD 3 (30% ≤ FEV<sub>1</sub> &lt; 50%), and 0.7% were GOLD 4 (FEV<sub>1</sub> &lt; 30%) group. The mean age of the COPD population was 64.7 (± 0.7) years, 72.5% were males, and 34.1% were current smokers. The prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency (≤15 ng/mL) was 26.9% in COPD patients and 32.4% in non-COPD patients. The participants’ demographic and clinical characteristics of COPD patients as compared with those of the non-COPD control group are summarized in <xref rid="pone.0138482.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Values of both 25-OHD and PTH were significantly higher in COPD group than in the control groups. EQ5D-index and EQ5D-VAS scores were lower in the COPD group (<xref rid="pone.0138482.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Vitamin D, PTH, and lung function</title>
<p>Since values of 25-OHD and PTH were not normally distributed, log transformations of these values were performed to evaluate their association with pulmonary function or quality of life. In COPD patients, the association between 25-OHD levels and FVC (% predicted) or FEV<sub>1</sub> (% predicted) was not significant in univariable analysis (<xref rid="pone.0138482.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). However, there was a negative correlation between PTH level and both FVC (% predicted) and FEV<sub>1</sub> (% predicted) (<xref rid="pone.0138482.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>), although PTH levels had a significant association with vitamin D levels (ß = 0.18; <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). Multivariable analysis of the relationship between lung function variables and values of vitamin D or PTH were performed, with each analysis adjusted for age, sex, height, BMI, current smoking status, and kidney disease. Vitamin D levels were not significantly associated with either FVC (% predicted) or FEV<sub>1</sub> (% predicted) in multivariable analysis (<xref rid="pone.0138482.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). In contrast, PTH values were independently correlated with decreased FVC (% predicted) (ß = - 0.07; <italic>P</italic> = 0.02) and FEV<sub>1</sub> (% predicted) (ß = - 0.11; <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) (<xref rid="pone.0138482.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<p>Since age, sex, BMI, smoking status, and underlying disease were different between non-COPD and COPD groups, the analysis of vitamin D values was adjusted by age, sex, BMI, current smoking status, and chronic kidney disease. Differences of adjusted log-vitamin D levels were neither apparent between non-COPD and COPD group (<italic>P</italic> = 0.06), nor among GOLD 1, 2, and 3–4 COPD patients (<italic>P</italic> = 0.40). Between non-COPD and COPD groups, difference of adjusted log-PTH levels also did not reach statistical significance (<italic>P</italic> = 0.08); however, among COPD patients, there was significant increase of adjusted log-PTH level with severity of airflow limitation (<italic>P</italic> = 0.03; <xref rid="pone.0138482.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>).</p>

<title>Vitamin D, PTH, and quality of life</title>
<p>Vitamin D level was not correlated with EQ5D-index or EQ5D-VAS score, but PTH level was correlated with EQ5D-index (ß = - 0.08; <italic>P</italic> = 0.01) (<xref rid="pone.0138482.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Multivariable analysis of the relationship between quality of life and values of vitamin D or PTH were performed, with each analysis adjusted for age, sex, BMI, current smoking status, COPD severity, diabetes, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease. Value of vitamin D had no significant relationship with either EQ5D-index or EQ5D-VAS score; however PTH level was significantly associated with EQ5D-index (ß = - 0.06; <italic>P</italic> = 0.04) in multivariable analysis (<xref rid="pone.0138482.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Correlation of PTH with EQ5D-VAS score was not significant (<italic>P</italic> = 0.45). EQ5D-index adjusted by same variables was compared according to quartile of vitamin D and PTH. Quartile (Q) cutoff values were Q1 &lt; 13.20, Q2 13.21–16.80, Q3 16.81–21.20, Q4 ≥ 21.21 for 25-OHD; and Q1 &lt; 50.70, Q2 50.71–63.70, Q3 63.71–80.30, Q4 ≥ 80.31 for PTH. Adjusted EQ5D-index was not different between quartiles of vitamin D (<italic>P</italic> = 0.54), but significantly different between quartiles of PTH (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). Decline of QOL was apparent in fourth quartile (<xref rid="pone.0138482.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). There was no statistical interaction between airflow limitation and PTH level for EQ5D-index (<italic>P</italic> = 0.23) and EQ5D-VAS score (<italic>P</italic> = 0.54).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, PTH levels were independently associated with FVC (% predicted), FEV<sub>1</sub> (% predicted), and quality of life in COPD patients. Vitamin D levels were neither associated with lung function nor with quality of life.</p>
<p>In previous studies, vitamin D was regarded as a possible biomarker for COPD. Many recent studies evaluating the role of vitamin D in COPD patients produced controversial results. Peter et al. showed a relationship between serum vitamin D and lung function in national survey data [<xref rid="pone.0138482.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Afzal et al. reported that lower vitamin D levels are associated with faster FEV<sub>1</sub> decline rate, higher prevalence of COPD, and higher risk of COPD development [<xref rid="pone.0138482.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, another prospective study by Skaaby et al. showed that although lower vitamin D levels correlated with higher COPD prevalence, vitamin D deficiency was not significantly associated with COPD development [<xref rid="pone.0138482.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Furthermore, Puhan et al. reported no significant correlation between vitamin D deficiency and COPD exacerbation or mortality [<xref rid="pone.0138482.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Additionally, Jackson et al. observed no difference of vitamin D levels between non-COPD and COPD groups, but described the elevation of PTH level in COPD patients [<xref rid="pone.0138482.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In our national survey data, 25-OHD level was lower in the control population than COPD patients, and 25-OHD level was not significantly associated with both lung function and quality of life.</p>
<p>One possible explanation for these discrepancies on the role of vitamin D in COPD patients is the complex interaction between vitamin D and PTH. In the human body, vitamin D level is controlled by various factors including PTH, in order to maintain calcium homeostasis [<xref rid="pone.0138482.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Because most of these studies did not measure the level of PTH which interacts with vitamin D, the effect of PTH on COPD could not be conclusively evaluated. Until now, we focused on the role of vitamin D in COPD without realizing the impact of PTH in COPD patients. Surprisingly our study suggests that not vitamin D, but PTH could be the key biomarker in COPD; however, owing to their interaction, vitamin D was identified as the indicator in many former studies. Previous report by Jackson et al. which showed elevation of adjusted PTH level in COPD patients also supports our findings [<xref rid="pone.0138482.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The major role of PTH is regulation of bone health and mineral homeostasis, but excess PTH may have possible effects beyond the regulation of calcium homeostasis. Though we could not evaluate the mechanism of poorer pulmonary function in PTH elevation, PTH might be a more effective biomarker than vitamin D for COPD patients, especially in regions with a high prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency. Furthermore, value of PTH could be independent predictor for quality of life regardless of degree of airflow limitation. In current GOLD guideline, staging of COPD is classified by both degree of airflow limitation and symptom score, and the importance of symptom score is emphasized by higher mortality rate [<xref rid="pone.0138482.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Levels of PTH, as well as vitamin D, are known to have reverse J-shaped association with mortality, and both elevated and decreased levels of PTH increase all-cause mortality in the general population [<xref rid="pone.0138482.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138482.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Although we did not observe the association between lower PTH levels with poor pulmonary function or quality of life, we did observe the association between higher PTH levels and decreased pulmonary function and quality of life, both of which can increase mortality in COPD patients. Further studies are needed to determine whether PTH affects lung tissue or lung disease causes secondary hyperparathyroidism.</p>
<p>Since the present study describes the novel relationship between PTH levels and COPD severity, the following limitations of the study are noted in an effort to aid in the interpretation of our results. First, we did not evaluate post-bronchodilator FEV<sub>1</sub> and FVC, which are commonly used as lung function parameters in COPD patients, as this study was part of the national health survey. Additionally we could not obtain data on diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO), emphysema status, coexistence of bronchiectasis, or other variables reflecting functional status such as the 6-minute walk distance, CAT score, SGRQ score. Hence, we used EuroQOL as the QOL index, which is a generic, but not a disease-specific questionnaire. Second, we could not evaluate serum calcium levels, which prevent calculation of prevalence of primary hyperparathyroidism. Third, we could not evaluate the seasonal variation of vitamin D and PTH, because limited access to the time of sampling owing to ethical concern for personal information. Fourth, we could not completely differentiate COPD from asthma, because KNAHNES included the self-reported questionnaires for asthma, but most patients did not perceive the difference of these diseases. Therefore, there could be contamination of longstanding, smoking-related asthma or overlap syndrome in our COPD population. As we could not identify the possible mechanism for these results, further detailed, larger trials to evaluate the role of PTH in COPD prevalence, exacerbation, lung function decline rate, functional status, and mortality are needed to confirm our findings.</p>
<p>In conclusion, elevation of PTH, unlike vitamin D, is independently associated with poorer lung function and quality of life. PTH may be a better biomarker for COPD patients, especially in regions with a high prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency.</p>
