<abstract>
<p>Platelets play pivotal roles in both hemostasis and thrombosis. Although models of intravital platelet imaging are available for thrombosis studies in mice, few are available for rat studies. The present effort aimed to generate fluorescent platelets in rats and assess their dynamics in a rat model of arterial injury. We generated CD41-ZsGreen1 transgenic rats, in which green fluorescence protein ZsGreen1 was expressed specifically in megakaryocytes and thus platelets. The transgenic rats exhibited normal hematological and biochemical values with the exception of body weight and erythroid parameters, which were slightly lower than those of wild-type rats. Platelet aggregation, induced by 20 μM ADP and 10 μg/ml collagen, and blood clotting times were not significantly different between transgenic and wild-type rats. Saphenous arteries of transgenic rats were injured with 10% FeCl<sub>3</sub>, and the formation of fluorescent thrombi was evaluated using confocal microscopy. FeCl<sub>3</sub> caused time-dependent increases in the mean fluorescence intensity of injured arteries of vehicle-treated rats. Prasugrel (3 mg/kg, p.o.), administered 2 h before FeCl<sub>3</sub>, significantly inhibited fluorescence compared with vehicle-treated rats (4.5 ± 0.4 vs. 14.9 ± 2.4 arbitrary fluorescence units at 30 min, respectively, n = 8, <italic>P</italic> = 0.0037). These data indicate that CD41-ZsGreen1 transgenic rats represent a useful model for intravital imaging of platelet-mediated thrombus formation and the evaluation of antithrombotic agents.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Formation of a thrombus in major arteries occurs in association with arteriosclerosis and is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in industrialized countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0154661.ref001">1</xref>]. Although various factors involved in life-threatening atherothrombotic processes are known and are targeted successfully with drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0154661.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0154661.ref003">3</xref>], unknown mechanisms must contribute to the pathogenesis of atherothrombosis. Atherothrombosis plays a critical role in many diseases, and understanding of the mechanisms involved in thrombus formation and progression may help in the prevention or treatment of myocardial infarction and stroke.</p>
<p>Among characterized atherothrombotic processes, platelets play several important roles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0154661.ref004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0154661.ref009">9</xref>]. Since platelet aggregation was first measured using a turbidimetric method by Born [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0154661.ref010">10</xref>], considerable progress has been made in understanding platelet aggregation and its control. However, the precise pathogenesis of thrombus formation in blood vessels requires further elucidation since it is difficult to extrapolate from <italic>in vitro</italic> findings to <italic>in vivo</italic> animal models and human disease states. Thus, for investigating platelet involvement <italic>in vivo</italic> physiological studies are advantageous [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0154661.ref011">11</xref>]. Real-time visualization of thrombus formation provides spatiotemporal information about events within the growing thrombus in the living animal. In rodent models, platelet thrombi are visualized using probes such as fluorescence-conjugated platelet antibodies or platelets labeled with fluorescent dyes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0154661.ref012">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0154661.ref015">15</xref>]. These intravital fluorescence imaging techniques were mainly adapted for mouse studies; however, there are few suitable <italic>in vivo</italic> models for imaging platelets of rats. Species differences, such as receptor distribution and drug reactivity, between rats and mice have been reported in several reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0154661.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0154661.ref017">17</xref>]. Platelet reactivity of rats also appears to be different from that of mice. Further, Nylander et al. (2006) have reported that certain aspects of human platelet reactivity are more similar to those of rats than mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0154661.ref018">18</xref>]. In addition to these species differences, since the body size of rats is larger than that of mice, several more elaborate thrombotic disease models are more easily created in rats compared to mice. Therefore, rat models of intravital imaging to evaluate <italic>in vivo</italic> platelet function will be of value.</p>
<p>The integrin CD41/CD61 (GPIIb/IIIa) plays a central role in platelet aggregation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0154661.ref019">19</xref>], and specific therapeutic antibodies are used clinically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0154661.ref020">20</xref>]. GPIIb/IIIa is a marker for hematopoietic differentiation and is specifically expressed by the mature megakaryocytic lineage, and thus in platelets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0154661.ref021">21</xref>]. Moreover, the promoter of the gene encoding CD41 is widely used to express megakaryocyte- and platelet-specific targeted proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0154661.ref022">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0154661.ref024">24</xref>]. For example, Zhang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0154661.ref022">22</xref>] generated CD41-yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) transgenic mice that express YFP under the control of the mouse promoter of the gene encoding the GPIIb-subunit of GPIIb/IIIa. In the present study, we adopted a similar strategy using the CD41 promoter of rats to specifically express a new fluorescent protein, ZsGreen1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0154661.ref025">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0154661.ref027">27</xref>], in platelets/megakaryocytes.</p>
<p>Thus the purpose of the present study was to generate fluorescent rat platelets and assess their dynamics in arteries injured by FeCl<sub>3</sub>. Further, we assessed the effect of the antiplatelet agent prasugrel on rat platelet dynamics and thrombus imaging at sites of arterial injury using intravital platelet thrombus imaging.</p>

<title>Generation of CD41-ZsGreen1 transgenic rats</title>
<p>Several lines of CD41-ZsGreen1 transgenic rats were generated and analyzed by Southern blotting to confirm the presence of the transgene in genomic DNA. When CD41-ZsGreen1 transgenic rat DNA was digested with PstI and hybridized to the ZsGreen1 probe described above, a 2.1 kb band was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0154661.g001">Fig 1</xref>). We analyzed the genomic DNAs of 19 transgenic founder lines using Southern blot analysis and performed flow cytometric analysis of platelets to select 10 lines for breeding. One founder line was selected because of its high percentage of ZsGreen1-positive platelets and its lack of detectable abnormal hematological, biochemical, or platelet aggregation values.</p>

<p>To assess ZsGreen1 expression in platelets, flow cytometric analysis was performed in wild-type and transgenic rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0154661.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were used as wild-type rats. In wild-type rats, a low level of ZsGreen1 fluorescence was detected. However, transgenic rats emitted more intense ZsGreen1 fluorescence. The percentage of CD61-positive platelets that expressed ZsGreen1 was 83.75% ± 0.59%. ZsGreen1 expression was not detectable at levels above baseline in other blood cells.</p>

<title>Characteristics of CD41-ZsGreen1 transgenic rats</title>
<p>We determined the general condition, hematological parameters, and biochemical parameters of CD41-ZsGreen1 transgenic rats that were 8 weeks of age. The general condition of CD41-ZsGreen1 transgenic rats did not differ significantly from that of wild-type rats except for body weight (236.0 ± 2.6 g vs. 272.7 ± 2.6 g). Hematological data are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0154661.t001">Table 1</xref>. The values of erythrocyte count, hematocrit, and hemoglobin concentration of CD41-ZsGreen1 transgenic rats were significantly lower and reticulocyte count was significantly higher than those of wild-type rats (erythrocyte count: 6.613 ± 0.093 × 10<sup>6</sup>/μl vs. 7.710 ± 0.127 × 10<sup>6</sup>/μl; hemoglobin concentration: 12.8 ± 0.2 g/dl vs. 14.5 ± 0.2 g/dl; hematocrit: 38.57% ± 0.54% vs. 43.43% ± 0.62%; reticulocyte: 6.467% ± 0.067% vs. 3.133% ± 0.120%, respectively). The values of other hematological measures were similar between wild-type and CD41-ZsGreen1 transgenic rats. Since, in the initial experiments a small number of animals were studied, we further evaluated these parameters in a subsequent study of wild-type and CD41-ZsGreen1 transgenic rats. The findings were as follows: body weight was 248.3 ± 2.4 g for wild-type rats and 198.8 ± 11.6 g for CD41-ZsGreen1 transgenic rats (n = 6 for each, <italic>P</italic> = 0.0019); erythrocyte counts were 7.93 ± 0.20 × 10<sup>6</sup>/μl for wild-type rats (n = 6) and 7.54 ± 0.13 × 10<sup>6</sup>/μl for CD41-ZsGreen1 transgenic rats (n = 5, <italic>P</italic> = 0.1467), confirming that CD41-ZsGreen1 transgenic rats exhibited a small, but significantly difference in body weight and a tendency to lower erythrocyte count.</p>

<p>Treatment of the saphenous artery with 10% FeCl<sub>3</sub> in vehicle animals increased fluorescence intensity only in the FeCl<sub>3</sub>-treated area after approximately 10 min of reflecting platelet-rich thrombus formation in the injured vessel. Platelet thrombus formation reached its maximum within approximately 20 min after FeCl<sub>3</sub> treatment. Variability of the averaged fluorescence intensity was relatively high due to differences among the times required to form the thrombi. However, the platelet thrombi grew rapidly once they began to grow in each vehicle-treated rat. In some rats, platelet thrombi repeatedly detached and re-formed. Fluorescence intensities 5 min after FeCl<sub>3</sub> treatment were not significantly different between the vehicle and prasugrel groups (4.72 ± 0.59 arbitrary fluorescence unit [aFU]∙min, 3.83 ± 0.07 aFU∙min, respectively, <italic>P</italic> = 0.1762), suggesting non-P2Y<sub>12</sub> pathways might be involved in the initiation of platelet aggregation. However, prasugrel significantly inhibited the formation of platelet thrombi starting 9 min after FeCl<sub>3</sub> application (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0154661.g006">Fig 6A</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the present study, we generated CD41-ZsGreen1 transgenic rats, which specifically expressed ZsGreen1 fluorescent protein in megakaryocytes and platelets. All physiological parameters that we assessed during the observation period were within normal laboratory ranges for wild-type rats. However, body weight of CD41-ZsGreen1 transgenic rats was slightly but significantly lower than that of wild-type rats, and erythroid parameters of CD41-ZsGreen1 transgenic rats tended to be lower than those of wild-type rats. The precise mechanism(s) that reduced body weight and reduced erythrocyte counts is unknown. Possible factors influencing these differences might be random insertion of the BAC transgene into the genome, unknown ZsGreen1 function, littermates not used as wild-type rat controls, etc. Since similar trends were observed in separate experiments and in other experiments using other lines of CD41-ZsGreen1 transgenic rats, the possibility of involvement of random BAC gene insertion in mediating lower body weights and erythrocyte parameters is considered low. Further studies are required to address this finding. Importantly, we determined that the ability of platelets to aggregate and blood clotting times, factors central to thrombus formation, were similar between wild-type and transgenic rats. Taken together, we conclude that CD41-ZsGreen1 transgenic rats may provide a valuable model for use in further intravital imaging studies of platelet function and its control.</p>
<p>Previous intravital platelet imaging studies have been done in mice and mainly employed antibodies conjugated to fluorescent reporters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0154661.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0154661.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0154661.ref028">28</xref>]. To our knowledge, few rat intravital platelet imaging studies have been published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0154661.ref029">29</xref>]. In the present effort, we initially attempted to label/detect platelets in rats using several commercially available fluorescent antibodies such as fluorescein-conjugated anti-CD41, anti-CD42b, and anti-integrin β3 antibodies. However, we were not successful in detecting platelet thrombi. Therefore, we generated transgenic rats, which specifically expressed the fluorescent protein ZsGreen1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0154661.ref027">27</xref>] in megakaryocytes and thus platelets, reflecting our strategy to employ the CD41 promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0154661.ref022">22</xref>].</p>
<p>We show here, using flow cytometric and histological analyses, megakaryocyte- and platelet-specific expression of the ZsGreen1 protein. We successfully detected individual circulating platelets and platelet aggregates in large arteries such as the saphenous and carotid arteries in the CD41-ZsGreen1 transgenic rats. Since ZsGreen1 is a green fluorescent protein derived from <italic>Zoanthus</italic> fluorescent protein and emits intense fluorescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0154661.ref027">27</xref>], individual circulating platelets could be detected. These data suggest that the CD41-ZsGreen1 transgenic rats with intense megakaryocyte- and platelet-specific fluorescence will be of value for intravital platelet imaging studies of rats.</p>
<p>The effects of platelet inhibitors on thrombus formation have been evaluated in traditional thrombosis models such as arterio-venous shunt models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0154661.ref030">30</xref>], photochemically-induced thrombosis models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0154661.ref031">31</xref>], and FeCl<sub>3</sub>-induced thrombosis models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0154661.ref032">32</xref>]. Among these studies, the FeCl<sub>3</sub>-injury model is one of the most intensively used for investigating the properties of antithrombotic agents, but is rarely used for intravital imaging studies. Therefore, in the present study, we investigated the effects of prasugrel, the third-generation thienopyridine antiplatelet agent, on the FeCl<sub>3</sub>-induced thrombosis in this novel model of intravital platelet thrombus imaging. Similar to our previous experience with more traditional rat models of thrombosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0154661.ref033">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0154661.ref035">35</xref>], 3 mg/kg of prasugrel completely inhibited thrombus formation induced by FeCl<sub>3</sub>, confirming the potent antithrombotic effect of prasugrel and the ability to detect this in the CD41-ZsGreen1 transgenic rats. Further, our present results indicate the ability of the model to follow the time-dependency of platelet thrombus formation and its inhibition.</p>
<p>In traditional models, thrombus formation is typically evaluated at one time point in each animal. The data presented here indicate that the CD41-ZsGreen1 transgenic rat model allows for the temporal determination of platelet participation in thrombus formation and for the evaluation of antithrombotic agents. In the present study, we used prasugrel as the only antithrombotic agent and used only FeCl<sub>3</sub> to induce thrombus. Further studies are therefore required to evaluate the effect of other antithrombotic agents in other models of thrombus formation.</p>
