				<p>Global lipidomics analysis across large sample sizes produces high-content datasets that require dedicated software tools supporting lipid identification and quantification, efficient data management and lipidome visualization. Here we present a novel software-based platform for streamlined data processing, management and visualization of shotgun lipidomics data acquired using high-resolution Orbitrap mass spectrometry. The platform features the ALEX framework designed for automated identification and export of lipid species intensity directly from proprietary mass spectral data files, and an auxiliary workflow using database exploration tools for integration of sample information, computation of lipid abundance and lipidome visualization. A key feature of the platform is the organization of lipidomics data in ”database table format” which provides the user with an unsurpassed flexibility for rapid lipidome navigation using selected features within the dataset. To demonstrate the efficacy of the platform, we present a comparative neurolipidomics study of cerebellum, hippocampus and somatosensory barrel cortex (S1BF) from wild-type and knockout mice devoid of the putative lipid phosphate phosphatase PRG-1 (plasticity related gene-1). The presented framework is generic, extendable to processing and integration of other lipidomic data structures, can be interfaced with post-processing protocols supporting statistical testing and multivariate analysis, and can serve as an avenue for disseminating lipidomics data within the scientific community. The ALEX software is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mslipidomics.info" xlink:type="simple"><underline>www.msLipidomics.info</underline></ext-link>. </p>

			<title>Introduction</title><p>The lipidome of eukaryotic cells comprises hundreds to thousands of molecular lipid species that constitute and functionalize biomembranes, store metabolic energy in lipid droplets and function as signaling molecules that control cell and organism physiology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. A key tenet of contemporary mass spectrometry-based lipidomics methodology revolves around the identification and quantification of lipid species on a lipidome-wide scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. As such, shotgun lipidomics has emerged as a powerful tool for global lipidome analysis that complements mechanistic studies of lipid metabolism, lipid homeostasis and membrane biology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The efficacy of shotgun lipidomics stems from its relative technical simplicity where hundreds of lipid species in sample extracts can be quantitatively monitored at high throughput using direct infusion nanoelectrospray ionization combined with high-resolution Fourier transform mass spectrometry (FT MS) or/and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Notably, lipidomics analysis on a global scale generates large amounts of (spectral) data that requires software routines for automated lipid identification and quantification, and additional data management for subsequent lipidome visualization and bioinformatics analysis.</p>
			<p>Extensive lipidome characterization by shotgun lipidomics can be achieved by executing a systematic program of mass spectrometric analyses of sample extracts in positive and negative ion mode, and by incorporating chemical derivatization procedures to specifically monitor poorly ionizing lipid molecules such as cholesterol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Executing such an analytical program generates several mass spectral data files per sample that must be queried for lipid identification, and combined into a single dataset for lipidome quantification and visualization. Numerous software tools have been developed for the identification of lipids: LipidQA[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], LIMSA[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], FAAT[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], lipID[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], LipidSearch[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], LipidView[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], LipidInspector[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] and LipidXplorer[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. These tools cover a broad range of applications spanning dedicated lipid identification for only certain instrumentations and specific mass analysis routines (MS and MS/MS) to cross-platform software featuring user-specified commands querying spectral data in the open-source .mzXML format. Identified lipid species are typically annotated by a shorthand nomenclature corresponding to the information detail of the mass spectrometric analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The detection of lipid species by FT MS analysis or by MS/MS analysis for lipid class-specific fragment ions (e.g. <italic>m/z</italic> 184.0733 for phosphatidylcholine (PC) species) supports only “sum composition” annotation (e.g. PC 34:1). In comparison, annotation by the more detailed “molecular composition” (e.g. PC 16:0-18:1) requires MS/MS analysis and detection of structure-specific fragment ions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. To support the cataloging of lipid species, the LIPID MAPS Consortium recently developed the “Comprehensive Classification System for Lipids” which outlines an informatics framework for lipidomics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Using a classification system enables the design of lipid databases where each lipid species is listed together with a range of accessory lipid features such as lipid category (e.g. glycerophospholipid, sphingolipid, glycerolipid, sterol lipid), lipid class, structural attributes (e.g. number of double bonds, fatty acid chain length), chemical formula, mono-isotopic mass and isotope information. These accessory lipid features can be incorporated into lipidomic data processing routines using database-orientated exploration tools to support computations and visualization of distinct lipidome hallmarks. Notably, none of the currently available software tools comprise streamlined processing routines that integrate lipid intensity data, the accessory lipid features and a full catalog of sample information. </p>
			<p>Here we present a platform for processing, management and visualization of high-content shotgun lipidomics datasets acquired using high-resolution Orbitrap mass spectrometry. The platform features a novel software framework termed ALEX (Analysis of Lipid Experiments) that supports automated identification and export of lipid species intensity directly from proprietary mass spectral data files and the integration of accessory lipid features and sample information into a single output structured in “database table format”. This design supports swift data processing and lipidome visualization across large sample sizes using an auxiliary workflow powered by the database exploration tools: Orange [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] and Tableau Software. To demonstrate the efficacy of the platform, we present a comparative neurolipidomics analysis of cerebellum, hippocampus and S1BF from wild-type and knockout mice devoid of the PRG-1 gene encoding a putative lipid phosphate phosphatase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p>

				<title>Input: high-resolution shotgun lipidomics data</title>
				<p>Shotgun lipidomics platforms based on high-resolution Orbitrap mass spectrometry and automated nanoelectrospray ionization support high throughput analysis with high sensitivity, specificity and extensive lipidome coverage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. The extensive lipidome coverage is generated by combined analyses of sample extracts in negative and positive ion mode, and by implementing chemical derivatization procedures to monitor low abundant or poorly ionizing lipid species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. In order to maximize the sensitivity of Orbitrap mass analysis, we typically record two multiplexed FT MS scans covering a low <italic>m/z</italic> range and high <italic>m/z</italic> range (e.g. +FT MS <italic>m/z</italic> 280-580 and +FT MS <italic>m/z</italic> 500-1200). Each FT MS scan is recorded in profile mode with a target mass resolution of 100,000. The rationale for this multiplexed FT MS analysis is that the instrument injects a user-specified quantum of ions into the Orbitrap for mass analysis (defined by the automated gain control). Hence, multiplexing two or more scan ranges allows separate quanta of ions within specific <italic>m/z</italic> ranges to be analyzed sequentially in the Orbitrap and yields better ion statistics as compared to injecting all ions at the same time when monitoring a wider <italic>m/z</italic> range (e.g. +FT MS <italic>m/z</italic> 200-1200) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. We note that the boundaries of the scan ranges should be chosen to cover specific lipid classes and respective internal standards. For example, the scan range +FT MS <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> 280-580 is used for monitoring LPC and LPE species whereas +FT MS <italic>m/z</italic> 500-1200 analysis is used for monitoring Cer, SM, HexCer, PC, PC O-, PE, PE O-, DAG and TAG species. The total time of analysis is typically set to 3 min. Within this time we record 25 low <italic>m/z</italic> and 25 high <italic>m/z</italic> range FT MS spectra. Likewise, negative ion mode analysis is also executed using multiplexed FT MS acquisitions to monitor negatively charged glycerophospholipid and SHexCer species (see Material and Methods). Consequently, this lipidomics approach generates four distinct mass spectral datasets per sample (two per polarity) that need to be queried for lipid identification and export of lipid species intensity. We note that this lipidomics approach is designed for high throughput-oriented studies and supports annotation of lipid species by sum composition nomenclature (e.g. PC 34:1). Characterization of molecular lipid species (e.g. PC 16:1-18:0) requires implementation of time-consuming MS/MS analysis and lipid identification by dedicated software such as LipidXplorer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p>
			</sec>
			<sec id="s3.2">
				<title>Design of the ALEX software framework</title>
				<p>The ALEX software framework was designed for processing of shotgun lipidomics datasets obtained by multiplexed high-resolution FT MS. The rationales for the design were: i) that ALEX should support lipidomic studies with large sample sets for which a multitude of multiplexed FT MS acquisitions have been acquired; and ii) that the output format of ALEX should be compatible with an auxiliary workflow that supports robust data processing including computation of molar abundances of lipid species across numerous lipid classes, integration of sample information, implementation of data quality control procedures and rapid lipidome visualization. To this end, we designed the ALEX software framework to utilize distinct modules that identify lipid species from proprietary .RAW spectral file format, incorporate accessory lipid features stored in a lipid database and output lipidomic data in “database table format” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079736-g001">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0079736.s001">Data S1</xref>). In this format, the lipidomic data is stored in tabulator or comma separated text files structured as database tables with a separate row for each data point. Each row separately contains fields (also termed attributes) reporting for example the originating sample (.RAW file name), the lipid species, adduct information, intensity, peak area, <italic>m/z</italic> values and accessory lipid features derived from the lipid database. This format also easily supports the management of multiple attributes for each data point (e.g. both peak intensity and area) and can be appended with calculated fields such as lipid abundance (e.g. both pmol and fmol, if needed), and sample information and internal standard information supplied by additional text files in database table format. Importantly, this relational database format provides a robust way to manage large datasets programmatically and avoids the need for error-prone manual alignment of data with lists of accessory features and quantification information. We note that the output of most contemporary lipidomics software tools utilizes a “spreadsheet” format where samples/injections are arranged in the columns and lipid species in the rows of a table of with either intensities or peak areas. This “spreadsheet” format is adequate for processing and visualizing simple lipidomic datasets using tools such as Microsoft Excel, but becomes exceedingly cumbersome if sample sets include more than 10 samples and monitor more than 200 lipid species across different FT MS scan ranges. </p>

The ALEX output is organized in database table format that can be accessed and processed by the auxiliary workflow using Orange and Tableau software.

				<title>ALEX lipid database</title>
				<p>To support identification of lipid species we constructed the ALEX lipid database. Currently, the database covers more than 20,000 lipid species from more than 85 lipid classes. Each lipid species in the database is annotated by sum composition and contains a range of accessory lipid features denoting its chemical formula, mono-isotopic mass, adduction in positive and negative ion mode, lipid category, lipid class, and the total number of C atoms, double bonds and hydroxyl group in fatty acid and long chain base moieties (termed C index, db index and OH index, respectively). The ALEX lipid database is available as a collection of text files and as a binary SQLite database queried by the ALEX lipid calculator and the ALEX target list generator, respectively (outlined in the next sections). The text version also serves as the source for the binary version (compiled by a supporting Python program) and can be edited by the user. To support the editing of the database, a template Microsoft Excel file can be used to assist the enumeration and calculation of the chemical formula and mass for each species, such that catalogs of entire lipid classes can readily be added. We note that the accessory lipid features serve as important attributes in the final ALEX output that facilitate data processing and lipidome visualization.</p>

				<title>ALEX lipid calculator</title><p>The ALEX lipid calculator was designed to complement manual inspection of FT MS spectra when using proprietary Xcalibur software (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079736-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). The calculator is available as executable program and as an online application at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mslipidomics.info/lipid-calc" xlink:type="simple"><underline>www.mslipidomics.info/lipid-calc</underline></ext-link>. Both versions of the ALEX lipid calculator support querying <italic>m/z</italic> values of specific lipid species and searching the lipid database for candidate lipid species that match a measured <italic>m/z</italic> value within a user-specified tolerance window. Since the accuracy of lipid identification can be hampered by drifts of the FT MS calibration we also implemented an option to specify an <italic>m/z</italic> offset while querying the lipid database. To accurately specify the calibration offset requires that the user knows the identity of at least one well-characterized “lock mass” ion that can be used for estimating the <italic>m/z</italic> offset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079736-g002">Figure 2</xref>). An option to minimize potential problems with FT MS calibration drifts is to apply online lock mass calibration during sample acquisition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. However, the online lock mass calibration eliminates the lock mass ion(s) from the recorded FT MS spectra using waveforms that might concomitantly eliminate lipid ions having similar <italic>m/z</italic>. An alternative strategy is to apply an offline lock mass adjustment as implemented in the ALEX extractor (outlined below).</p>

				<title>ALEX converter</title>
				<p>A prerequisite for automated lipid identification and export of intensity is that the mass spectrometric data in proprietary .RAW format are made accessible for querying. To this end, we designed the ALEX converter to interface with the proprietary dynamic-link library MSFileReader. The MSFileReader supports export of all scan information within .RAW files including single and averaged spectral peak lists in either centroid or profile mode format. The ALEX converter was designed to export individual spectral peak lists in profile mode format, to average peak lists for specific FT MS scan ranges and to save these averaged peak lists in .txt format. The ALEX converter output consists of a directory with separate folders named according to each FT MS scan range containing corresponding .txt files named according to the originating .RAW files (i.e. the ALEX converter does not merge overlapping FT MS scan ranges). Output files in these FT MS scan range-dependent folders are queried by the ALEX extractor (outlined below). The rationales for this design were i) that no available software supports export of multiplexed FT MS data in profile mode format; and ii) that a simple output text format reporting averaged peak list data allows users to easily review data as in contrast to accessing data in stored in the encrypted .mzXML format. </p>

				<title>ALEX target list generator</title><p>Lipid identification by the ALEX software framework is based on matching intensity data in the exported peak lists with lipid species information derived from the ALEX lipid database. Important for the design of the identification routine was the ability to accurately identify lipid species, and furthermore to support integration of accessory lipid features and subsequent data management for a multitude of lipid species monitored by various FT MS scan ranges across large sample sets. To this end, the ALEX framework was designed to perform a targeted identification of lipid species and export intensity by querying spectral peak lists using target lists with lipid species and respective <italic>m/z</italic> values. Two modules execute this routine: (i) the ALEX target list generator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079736-g003">Figure 3A</xref>) which compiles target lists by querying the ALEX lipid database, and (ii) the ALEX extractor which uses the target lists to identify and extract lipid species intensity (outlined in the next section). We note that a distinct target list with appropriate lipid species should be manually compiled for each FT MS scan range. In addition to listing lipid species and respective <italic>m/z</italic> values, the target lists also include the accessory lipid features derived from the ALEX lipid database. Importantly, these accessory lipid features are incorporated into the final output, and used for processing and visualization by the auxiliary workflow. </p>

The ALEX target list generator output is a .txt file with a shortlist of selected lipid species, respective <italic>m/z</italic> values and accessory lipid features.

				<title>ALEX extractor and ALEX unifier</title>
				<p>The ALEX extractor identifies lipid species and exports intensities by querying the averaged peak lists produced by the ALEX converter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079736-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). As input the ALEX extractor requires the folder location containing averaged peak lists, an appropriate target list (i.e. specific for the FT MS scan range) to query the peak lists and a destination folder to deposit output text files. Notably, the ALEX extractor also requires an <italic>m/z</italic> tolerance window to identify lipid species. This <italic>m/z</italic> tolerance window is dependent on instrumental mass resolution and typically set to ±0.0020 amu when processing FT MS data acquired with a target resolution at 100,000. To export lipid species intensity the ALEX extractor selects the maximum intensity value within the specified tolerance window and reports the corresponding <italic>m/z</italic> bin value. As mentioned above, the FT MS calibration can drift during the sample analysis and depending on the time of analysis can yield either a constant calibration offset or a progressively changing offset (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079736-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). In order to monitor and adjust lipid searches for potential calibration drifts, we incorporated a novel feature in the ALEX extractor termed “lock mass adjustment”. Lock mass adjustment serves to correct the <italic>m/z</italic> values of targeted lipid species for calibration drifts and thereby support more accurate lipid identification. This lock mass adjustment can be specified as a constant <italic>m/z</italic> offset and applied across all samples being processed. Alternatively, the ALEX extractor features an in-build automatic lock mass adjustment routine that calculates <italic>m/z</italic> calibration offsets for each sample based on selected lock mass ions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079736-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). The calculation of calibration offset uses a three-point quadratic interpolation for estimating the centroid <italic>m/z</italic> values of lock mass ions. We note that the automatic lock mass adjustment requires selection of well-characterized and ubiquitous ions as lock masses. For example, by positive ion mode FT MS analysis we always detect both the chemical background ion tris(ditert-butylphenyl) phosphate and the internal standard TAG 17:1/17:1/17:1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079736-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Using these ions as lock masses enables estimation of the FT MS calibration offset for individual samples and correcting lipid searches by adjusting the <italic>m/z</italic> values of targeted lipid species for each sample. As exemplified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079736-g002">Figure 2</xref>, using these lock mass ions allows identification of endogenous lipid species with a mass error of 0.4 ppm instead of 1 ppm when ignoring the FT MS calibration offset. Hence, this automated lock mass adjustment routine serves to improve the accuracy of lipid species identification despite drifts in FT MS calibration. </p>

				<p>The ALEX extractor outputs, for each FT MS scan range, several comma-separated value (.csv) files with lipid species intensity data and calculated lock mass adjustments for all processed samples. Notably, the lipid species intensity output is organized in database table format and includes attributes that track the originating .RAW file name, lipid species intensity and peak area, measured <italic>m/z</italic>, calculated <italic>m/z</italic>, the difference between measured and calculated <italic>m/z</italic>, and all the accessory lipid features included on the target list. We note that these sample attributes facilitate subsequent processing and visualization, and implementation of quality control procedures. In order to merge lipid species data from different FT MS ranges, we devised the ALEX unifier to concatenate selected .csv output files into one final .csv file which contains the union of all data and an additional column with an index, “rangeID”, that tracks the FT MS scan range of the input .csv files. This output format supports further data processing including computation of lipid abundance by the auxiliary workflow using open-source Orange [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] and Tableau Software. </p>

				<title>Application of the ALEX software framework</title>
				<p>In order to demonstrate the efficacy of the ALEX software framework and describe the auxiliary workflow, we here present a neurolipidomic pilot study. Three brain tissues; cerebellum, hippocampus and S1BF from two control mice and two mice devoid of the PRG-1 gene were subjected to shotgun lipidomics analysis. Homogenates of the tissues (12 samples in total) and two blank samples were spiked with defined amounts of internal lipid standards and subjected to 2-step lipid extraction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The apolar (10:1-) and polar (2:1-phase) lipid extracts were analyzed by multiplexed FT MS analysis in positive and negative ion mode, respectively. Each sample extract was analyzed twice (technical replicates). In total, this analysis produced 56 .RAW files (14 samples analyzed twice per polarity). </p>
				<p>First, the ALEX converter was used to convert .RAW files to spectral peak lists (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079736-g001">Figure 1</xref>). This processing produced a total of 112 peak list files (56 .RAW files, two FT MS scan ranges per polarity). The peak list files were automatically organized into 4 folders named according to polarity and scan range: +FTMS <italic>m/z</italic> 280-580, +FTMS <italic>m/z</italic> 500-1200, -FTMS <italic>m/z</italic> 370-660, and -FTMS <italic>m/z</italic> 550-1700 (each folder having 28 peak list files). Next, target lists with lipid species for each of the four FT MS <italic>m/z</italic> ranges were generated using the ALEX target list generator (See Materials and Methods for details). These target lists were subsequently used by the ALEX extractor to identify lipid species and export corresponding intensities from the peak list files. In addition, the processing by the ALEX extractor was performed using lock mass ions for each FT MS <italic>m/z</italic> range in order to monitor and correct searches for FT MS calibration drifts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079736-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Finally, the ALEX unifier was applied to merge the four ALEX extractor output files into single output files reporting all identified lipid species, intensities and accessory lipid features, and lock mass information and calculated FT MS calibration offsets. </p>
				<p>As a first step in the auxiliary workflow we performed a quality control of the neurolipidomics dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079736-g001">Figure 1</xref>). To this end, we accessed the lock mass information using Tableau Software and displayed the estimated FT MS calibration offsets as function of sample injection. This quality control showed that the calibration offset was not constant across all samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079736-g004">Figure 4</xref>) and thus highlighting the efficacy of the automatic lock mass adjustment. Importantly, for one sample we observed no intensity of the selected lock mass ion TAG 17:1/17:1/17:1. By manual inspection of the .RAW data, we concluded that the investigator in charge had failed to spike internal lipid standards into the particular sample. Consequently, this quality control demonstrated that the particular sample (cerebellum from a knockout mouse) could not be used for computing the molar amount of lipid species. As an additional quality control procedure we also accessed the output file with lipid species intensity data using Tableau Software, and displayed both the absolute intensity and intensity profile of monitored lipid species within lipid classes for all samples analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079736-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). This analysis showed that a low abundant ion in the blank samples was falsely identified as PI 40:3. Due to the low intensity of this ion and its presence in the blank samples we concluded that this ion represents a chemical background ion. To minimize bias from falsely identified background ions one can implement a background subtraction during the subsequent computation of molar lipid abundance using the Orange software. Moreover, it is recommendable to perform additional tandem mass analysis to assess the identity of dubious identification.</p>

				<title>Outlining the auxiliary workflow</title><p>In order to compute molar abundance (e.g. fmol) of lipid species we made use of the database exploration tool and open-source software Orange [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The molar abundance of lipid species is easily computed via a sequence of processing steps (depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079736-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). Step (1); the lipid species intensity data generated by the ALEX framework is specified as input (icon (a)) and merged with a second input specifying sample information (e.g. tissue type, genetic information, name of mice; icon (b)). Step (2); an intensity filter is implemented in order to remove intensities below a user-specified threshold if deemed necessary. Step (3); a third input specifying the spiked amount of internal standards is incorporated (icon (c)). Step (4); a new attribute is defined by specifying the intensities of internal standards. This attribute is used in step (6) for computing the molar abundance. Step (5); internal standards and corresponding intensities are defined for the subsequent calculation of molar lipid abundances. Step (6); an equation using the attributes lipid species intensity, internal standard intensity and spiked amount of internal standard is applied for calculating the molar lipid abundance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Step (7); processed data is saved as a .csv output file (in database table format) that can be accessed for computation of mol% and lipidome visualization by Tableau Software. We here note that the Orange schema produced an output file of the neurolipidomics analysis featuring 997 targeted lipid species with accessory information across 56 sample injections producing a data matrix with a total of 1,050,504 data points (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0079736.s001">Data S1</xref>).

				<p>To support rapid and efficient visualization of large lipidome datasets, we integrated Tableau Software as part of the auxiliary workflow. Tableau Software can be dynamically linked to the Orange output files such that any potential modifications within the data processing procedure can be visualized simply by updating the Orange output file and the link to Tableau. Notably, the Tableau software includes a feature that easily allows calculation and display of “mol% of lipid species” normalized to any given set of attributes and accessory lipid features in the input file. As such, the user can rapidly display the “mol% of all monitored PE species” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079736-g006">Figure 6C</xref>) or “mol% of all monitored glycerophospholipid species” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079736-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). We note, that calculation of such data formats would require implementation of additional processing steps within Orange (and equally in Microsoft Excel) in order to calculate and output such data values. We also note that these accessory lipid features provided by the ALEX framework, and consequently the information content in database table format, facilitates lipidome visualization by Tableau software.</p>

				<title>Application of the auxiliary workflow</title><p>To illustrate the efficacy of the auxiliary workflow we here present the results of the neurolipidomic pilot study. First, we assessed the lipid class composition of the three mouse brain tissues from wild-type and PRG-1 knockout mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079736-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). The lipid class composition of brain tissues was primarily comprised of PC, PE, PE O-, PS, PI, SM and HexCer lipids. In addition, the analysis also showed a low abundance of Cer, SHexCer, CE and TAG species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079736-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). This result corroborates previous reports on brain lipid composition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Notably, comparing the lipid class composition of the brain tissues did not show any pronounced differences between the wild-type and PRG-1 knockout mice. Moreover, the analysis also did not show any major difference in lipid class composition between the three brain tissues. To further interrogate the lipidome data, we explored alternative display formats including lipid category composition (e.g. glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids and glycerolipids, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079736-g006">Figure 6A</xref>), lipid species composition within a defined lipid class (e.g. PE species, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079736-g006">Figure 6C</xref>), lipid species composition across a defined lipid category (e.g. all glycerophospholipids, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079736-g006">Figure 6D</xref>) and db index within a defined lipid class (e.g. LPS, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079736-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). Using the various modes of lipidome visualization, we observed that each of the three mouse brain tissues featured specific signatures of lipid species. Specifically, we observed that the composition of PE species was different between all three tissues; the hippocampus comprised a relatively high level of PE 38:4, the S1BF contained relatively high levels of PE 40:6, and the cerebellum contained a relatively high level of PE 40:6 and minor but systematically higher levels of PE 34:1, PE 36:1 and PE 36:2 as compared to the two other tissues. These distinct lipidome hallmarks could also be observed when assessing the collective lipid species composition across all glycerophospholipids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079736-g006">Figure 6D</xref>) albeit with a less pronounced differences as compared to only PE species. The specific lipid compositions of the three brain tissues were further interrogated by visualizing the distribution of double bonds within the fatty acid moieties of LPS species. This visualization revealed that the S1BF comprised relatively high levels of LPS species with 0 double bonds (primarily attributed LPS 18:0) being offset by lower levels of LPS species having 6 double bonds (attributed LPS 22:6). In comparison, the cerebellum showed a characteristic distribution of LPS species with higher levels of species with 1 double bond as compared to the two other tissues. The LPS composition of the hippocampus comprised a double bond distribution intermediate of the S1BF and the cerebellum. We note that the lipidome visualization did not reveal any pronounced differences in lipid species composition between any of the tissues from wild-type and PRG-1 knockout mice. This observation is furthermore substantiated by results of principal component analysis (data not shown). </p>

			<title>Conclusions</title>
			<p>Here we presented a platform for streamlined processing, computation and visualization of high-content lipidomics datasets acquired using high-resolution Orbitrap mass spectrometry. The platform features a novel routine for querying proprietary spectral data that supports identification and quantification of lipid species, execution of quality control routines and rapid visualization of lipidome data. The platform utilizes three software modules: the ALEX framework that accesses and queries mass spectral data, the visual programming tool Orange that integrates sample information and computes molar lipid abundances, and the visual analytical tool Tableau Software for lipidome visualization. A key asset of the framework is the storage of lipidome data in “database table format” that enables using a multitude of data attributes for robust data processing and visualization. To demonstrate the efficacy of the platform, we presented a comparative neurolipidomic pilot study of mouse cerebellum, hippocampus and S1BF from wild-type and PRG-1 knockout mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The analysis demonstrated a distinct lipid species signature for each of the three brain tissues, but failed to ascertain any pronounced perturbations of lipid composition in mice devoid of the PRG-1 gene. This observation can potentially be explained by the localized expression of PRG-1 in the postsynaptic density of glutamatergic synapses. Regional differences in the lipidome composition induced by PRG-1 deficiency might potentially be concealed by the complexity of the macroscopic brain tissues investigated herein. We note that the ALEX framework can easily be adapted for processing of high-resolution shotgun lipidomics data acquired by any type of instrumentation (e.g. LTQ FT, Q Exactive, Orbitrap Fusion, solariX) provided spectral peak lists are stored in .txt file format. Moreover, the Orange processing procedure and Tableau visualization can be extended to include various filters for improved lipid identification, to calculate molar abundance of lipid species per unit of sample material (e.g. pmol lipid/µg protein), to perform statistical testing or multivariate analysis, and to integrate and support processing and visualization of lipidome data acquired by MS/MS analysis. Notably, the auxiliary workflow can also be adapted to use other database-orientated exploration tools than Orange and Tableau software. Finally, we argue that storage of lipidomics data in database table format can be a future avenue for data dissemination since it enables investigators to easily access, inspect and apply such resource data. </p>
