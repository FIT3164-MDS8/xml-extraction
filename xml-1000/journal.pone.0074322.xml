Moreover, nsPEF could also inactivate metastasis and invasion in cancer cells by suppressing Wnt/β-Catenin signaling pathway to down-regulating expressions of VEGF and MMPs family proteins. More importantly, nsPEF could function safely and effectively as an anti-cancer therapy through inducing tumor cell apoptosis, destroying tumor microenvironment, and depressing angiogenesis in tumor tissue <italic>in vivo</italic>.

			<title>Introduction</title>
			<p>Cancer are still a leading cause of death worldwide and accounted for 7.6 million deaths (around 13% of all deaths) in 2008 according to WHO, and deaths from cancer are projected to rise to over 11 million in 2030 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. A significant proportion of cancers can be cured by surgery, radiotherapy or chemotherapy, especially if they are detected early. However, some kinds of cancers cannot be discovered in early stage and have little response to radiotherapy and chemotherapy, thus patients with such cancers have a poor prognosis. For example, pancreatic cancer has approximately 23% 1-year survival after diagnosis and 5% 5-year survival at best [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Furthermore, there were an estimated 43,140 new cases and 36, 800 deaths attributed to pancreatic cancer in the United States [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. It is essential to search for a new therapy technique to improve prognosis and survival of cancer patients.</p>
			<p>A new technology using high pulsed electric field has emerged from military application into biology and medicine by applying nanosecond pulse electric field (nsPEF) as a means to inhibit cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The main characteristic of nsPEF is its high power and low energy leading to very little heat production and its special ability to penetrate into cell to influence intracellular organelles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Quite different from classical plasma membrane electroporation, nsPEF can produce highly compressed power (billions of watts), ultra short pulse durations (nanosecond), rapid rise times (nanosecond) and high electric fields (kV/cm). The resulting nanosecond pulse can penetrate into cell before plasma membrane is fully charged allowing nsPEF to have minimal affect plasma membrane therefore not causing electroporation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Recent years, studies have been done to determine effects of nsPEF in experimental and model researches. The results proved that nsPEF could induce apoptosis in various cancer cell lines <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and a fibrosarcoma tumor <italic>ex vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], and eradicate B16f10 melanoma tumor <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. However, molecular mechanisms of biological effects of nsPEF on tumors or cancers are still unclear.</p>
			<p>In this research, we sought to investigate anti-cancer effect of nsPEF and its possible molecular mechanisms through <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments. Here, we showed that nsPEF could significantly inhibit cancer growth <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> via inducing apoptosis, inhibiting proliferation, inactivating invasion and metastasis, and destroying tumor microenvironment, which will provide a novel and effective therapeutic strategy for cancers.</p>

				<title>Tumor induction in nude mice with Hep-3B cells</title>

Experimental animals were kept in the central animal facility of Zhejiang University School of Medicine and housed in laminar-ﬂow cabinets under speciﬁc pathogen-free conditions at 22 °C with a 12 h light/dark cycle. All mice were anesthetized with ketamine (100 mg/kg intraperitoneal). Tumor-bearing mice models were established through injection of 2×10<sup>6</sup> Hep-3B cells in the right abdomen in mice. At 1 week after cell injection, tumor was typically 3 mm wide and had exhibited angiogenesis. When tumors grew to 10 mm wide or more--- typically about 4 weeks after cell injection, 50 tumor-bearing mice models were successfully established and divided into two groups: Control group (n=17) and nsPEF group (n=33). The mice in the nsPEF group were exposed to nsPEF (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0074322.s001">Figure <bold>S1 D&amp; E</bold></xref>, 100 pulses, 20kV/cm) with the clamp. The clamp electrodes were made from plastic holder clamp with 5-mm wide thin copper to cover the tumor. We coated these electrodes with an ultrasound gel to separate the skin from the electrode. For treatment, each tumor was positioned between two palms of the clamps with a separation of 0.5 mm, while 100 ns pulses in duration and 20 kV/cm in intensity were applied at a frequency of 0.5 Hz. Throughout the experiment, the mouse was anesthetized and positioned on a warming stage that maintains the mouse’s body temperature within the normal range. Physical activities and weights of the mice as well as each tumor were observed and recorded once or twice per week. All procedures were performed in accordance with the ‘‘Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals’’ published by the National Institutes of Health (NIH publication 86–23 revised 1985).

			<title>Results and Discussion</title>
			<p>Despite intensive efforts in cancers treatment practices, survival rates for some kinds of cancers have not been substantially improved in past years, such as pancreatic cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], prostatic carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and lung cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Novel treatment strategies are therefore desperately required for treatment of cancers and long survival of patients. During the multistep development, human cancers acquire ten biological hallmarks including resisting cell death, sustaining proliferative signaling, activating invasion and metastasis, enabling replicative immortality, evading growth suppressors, inducing angiogenesis, reprogramming of energy metabolism, evading immune destruction, tumor-promoting inflammation, and genome instability and mutation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. These hallmarks constitute an organizing principle for rationalizing the complexities of neoplastic disease and also become major targets for cancer research and therapeutic strategies. As a relatively new technology to interpret cancer, nsPEF is effective in various cell lines <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], and B16f10 melanoma and hepatocellular carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], as well as human pancreatic carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] <italic>in vivo</italic>, demonstrating potential application prospect of nsPEF for cancer therapy. However, until now, it remains unclear on molecular mechanisms of nsPEF on cancers.</p>
			<p>In this study, we used cancer models both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments to search for possible molecular mechanisms.</p>
			<sec id="s3.1">
				<title>NsPEF induced cancer cells death and proliferative inhibition <italic>in vitro</italic></title>
				<p>To address effect of nsPEF in PANC-1 cells, cells were exposed to nsPEF with electric field at 0, 20, 40 and 60 kV/cm respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074322-g001">Figure <bold>1A</bold></xref>). The rate of viable cells/control was detected by counting trypan blue negative cells at 0h, 0.5h, 1h and 2h post pulse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074322-g001">Figure <bold>1B</bold></xref>). We found that viable cells post pulse were significantly decreased compared with the control (p&lt;0.001), but the time-dependent manner and dose-dependent manner of this reduced trend were not observed in a short time post pulse, at least within 2h. Moreover, treated cells were cultured for 24h and 48h, and then calculated respectively. We found that the viable cells were also remarkably reduced versus the control (both p&lt;0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074322-g001">Figure <bold>1C&amp; D</bold></xref>). In addition, inhibition rates of cell proliferation, detected by CCK-8 assay, were remarkably increasing in different intensities at 48h and 72h after exposure to nsPEF. Especially at 72h after pulse, higher intensities acquired higher inhibition rates, which displayed a dose-dependent manner, indicating that the proliferation of survival cells was influenced with dose-dependence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074322-g001">Figure <bold>1E</bold></xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074322-g001">Figure 1</xref> showed not only cells deaths, but also inhibition of cell proliferation induced by nsPEF.</p>

				<title>NsPEF induced cell apoptosis via the dependent-mitochondria intrinsic apoptotic pathway <italic>in vitro</italic></title>
				<p>First, to investigate death characteristics induced by nsPEF in pancreatic carcinoma cells, we detected morphology changes of cells after treatment by TEM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074322-g002">Figure <bold>2A</bold></xref>). Apoptotic characteristics of cells were rarely observed in the control (0kV/cm). However, treated cells with 20kV/cm nsPEF began to present cell morphology alteration of early apoptosis: nuclear shrinkage, nuclear notch, chromatin condensation and margination, and minor mitochondria degeneration. Under effect of 40kV/cm nsPEF, further changes were observed, mainly including chromatin clumping, cytoplasm condensing and some vacuoles appearing on cell membrane or in cytoplasm. Meanwhile, nuclear fragments and cytoplasm constituents were packaged into apoptotic bodies, and mitochondria showed vacuolar degeneration. When electric fields increased up to 60kV/cm, treated cells presented membrane lysis, nuclear membrane blebbing, nuclear lysis and fragmentation as well as mitochondria damage, which were typically considered as necrosis.</p>

				<p>Subsequently, we studied DNA damage and fragmentation by TUNEL assay and apoptosis DNA ladder assay. In TUNEL staining, the labels combined damaged sites of DNA, and apoptotic cells were stained brownish–yellow. We observed that TUNEL positive rates were obviously rising up in PANC-1 cells post pulse at 20, 40, and 60 kV/cm compared with the control, respectively (all p&lt;0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074322-g002">Figure <bold>2B</bold></xref>). Consistent with TUNEL results, DNA fragmentation presented in PANC-1 cells exposed to nsPEF at 20 and 40 kV/cm as compared to positive control and negative control from DNA ladder assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074322-g002">Figure <bold>2C</bold></xref>).</p>
				<p>To further investigate apoptotic degree in cancer cells post pulse, we tested apoptotic rates of treated cells with Annexin-V/PI staining by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074322-g002">Figure <bold>2D</bold></xref>). Compared with the control, the rate of Annexin V<sup>-</sup>PI<sup>-</sup> cells (viable cells) was significantly decreased after exposure to nsPEF, but the rate of Annexin V<sup>+</sup>PI<sup>-</sup> cells (early apoptosis) was remarkably increased at 20kV/cm (p&lt;0.001), and then significantly decreased at 40kV/cm (p&lt;0.05) and 60kV/cm (p&lt;0.01). In sharp contrast, the rate of Annexin V<sup>+</sup>PI<sup>+</sup> cells (late apoptosis or necrosis) was continually increasing in dose-dependence at 20, 40 and 60 kV/cm (all p&lt;0.01). These data suggested cells death induced by nsPEF presented from early apoptosis to late apoptosis or necrosis with increased intensities of nsPEF, in other words, dose-dependence. These results were identical with our findings via cell TEM.</p>
				<p>Recent researches proved that apoptosis played an important role in cell death induced by nsPEF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Consistent with these studies, we found apoptotic body and mitochondria degeneration by TEM after nsPEF treatment. Furthermore, results of TUNEL assay, apoptosis DNA ladder assay and Annexin-V/PI staining also proved apoptosis induced by nsPEF in PANC-1 cells. Some studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] reported that cancer cell death induced by nsPEF was mainly attributed to apoptosis, and interpreted that increase of Annexin V<sup>+</sup>PI<sup>+</sup> cells in dose-dependence might be ascribed to a special “mimicking necrosis” that high dose pulse induced bigger holes in cell membranes and then PI stain entered cells. However, our further evidence via cell TEM proved that cell death presented from early apoptosis to late apoptosis or necrosis with increased intensities of nsPEF, not just cell apoptosis.</p>
				<p>The intrinsic apoptosis induced by stress-inducing stimuli and extrinsic apoptosis via death receptor activation are two main pathways of apoptosis. Mitochondria function and anti-/pro-apoptosis Bcl-2 proteins family play essential roles in intrinsic apoptosis pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Anti-/pro-apoptosis Bcl-2 proteins family members are initially integral membrane proteins found in the mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), or nuclear membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. A major activating site of Bcl-2 proteins is mitochondrial membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. To explore possible mechanisms of apoptosis induced by nsPEF, we detected relative proteins expression of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, such as pro-apoptosis Bcl-2 family proteins (Bad, p-Bad, Bax, Bik, Bim, BID, Bak and Puma), pro-survival Bcl-2 family proteins (p-Bcl-2, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and Mcl-1), and apoptosis directly relative proteins (Cytochrome-C and Caspase-3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074322-g002">Figure <bold>2E</bold></xref>). Compared to the control, expressions of anti-apoptosis Bcl-2 family proteins, mainly including p-Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and Mcl-1, were remarkably reduced at different degrees, while expressions of pro-apoptosis Bcl-2 family proteins, mainly including Bax, Bim and BID, were significantly elevated at different degrees with increased intensities of nsPEF. Meanwhile, expressions of Cytochrome-C and Caspase-3 were obviously increased after exposure to nsPEF. We concluded that the apoptosis induced by nsPEF was triggered by regulating imbalance of anti- or pro-apoptosis Bcl-2 family proteins on the mitochondrial membrane. These results were consistent with mitochondria degeneration and damage in cell ultra-structure. Collectively, these apoptotic data indicated that nsPEF induced apoptosis in PANC-1 cells via the dependent mitochondria intrinsic apoptosis pathway that was triggered by imbalance of anti- or pro-apoptosis Bcl-2 family proteins.</p>

				<p>NF-κB signaling pathway plays an important role in cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Cancer growth inhibition via inhibiting NF-κB pathway has recently been reported in several human carcinomas, such as colon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], lung [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] and breast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. The target genes regulating cell proliferation via NF-κB pathway include c-Myc, CyclinD1, Cyclin E and CDK2 which play an essential role in positive or negative regulation of cell cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. To further explore possible mechanisms of proliferative inactivity of pulsed cells, we detected expressions of NF-κB signaling pathway proteins and Cyclin proteins in PANC-1 cells. Our results revealed that expressions of NF-κB pathway proteins including IKK-α, IKK-β, IκB-α, NF-κB p-65 and p-p65 were obviously decreased after exposure to nsPEF versus the control (all p&lt;0.01 or 0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074322-g003">Figure <bold>3B</bold></xref>). Higher intensity of nsPEF led to much lower expressions of these proteins compared with the control. Meanwhile, expressions of Cyclin proteins including CyclinD1 and Cyclin A were also significantly reduced after exposure to nsPEF versus the control (p&lt;0.01, 0.001, or 0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074322-g003">Figure <bold>3C</bold></xref>). So we considered that nsPEF could depress NF-κB signaling pathway to reduce expressions of Cyclin proteins.</p>

				<p>Accumulated evidence has demonstrated that Wnt/β-Catenin signaling pathway plays a critical role in embryonic development and human various malignancies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. The actions of Wnt/β-Catenin signaling pathway on target cells mainly include alterations in gene expression, cell polarization, migration and invasion through regulation of distinct downstream responsive molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. As downstream effector of Wnt/β-Catenin signaling pathway, MMPs family proteins and VEGF play a critical role in tumor invasion and metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Thus we detected protein expressions of Wnt/β-Catenin signaling pathway, MMPs family and VEGF. We found that expressions of Wnt/β-Catenin signaling pathway proteins mainly including hDPR1, β-Catenin and c-Myc in cancer cells exposed to nsPEF were remarkably decreased with dose-dependence versus the control (p&lt;0.05 at 20kV/cm, p&lt;0.01 at 40kV/cm, p&lt;0.001 at 60kV/cm) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074322-g004">Figure <bold>4C</bold></xref>).

				<title>How nsPEF functioned as an anti-tumor therapy <italic>in vivo</italic></title>
				<p>To further explore possible mechanisms of anti-tumor function of nsPEF <italic>in vivo</italic>, we next carried out H&amp;E staining, TEM, TUNEL and IHC staining for tumor tissue. First, we observed cell shrinkage, nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio reduction, angiorhagia, substantial erythrocytes distribution and leucocytes infiltration in tumor tissue in nsPEF group versus the control by histology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074322-g006">Figure <bold>6A</bold></xref>).

				<p>NF-κB signaling pathway is involved in a variety of cellular functions, including self-sufficiency in growth signals, insensitivity to growth-inhibitors, evasion of apoptosis, limitless replicative potential, tissue invasion and metastasis, and sustained angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Wnt/β-Catenin signaling pathway probably integrates with other niche-derived signals such as Shh, Notch and BMP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. In some conditions, these signals may function independently for respective aspects of cells or tissue self-renewal, such as survival, proliferation, inhibition of differentiation, metastasis and invasion. In other contexts, the various signaling pathways may function in a shared hierarchy and regulate each other. For example, NF-κB signaling pathway had been proved to regulate expressions of MMPs family proteins and VEGF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] which also were regulated by Wnt/β-Catenin signaling pathway. Moreover, Wnt/β-Catenin signaling pathway can regulate expression of cyclinD1 in colon carcinoma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] and target identification of c-Myc oncogene in colorectal cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>], while NF-κB signaling pathway target genes regulating proliferation include CyclinD1, Cyclin E, CDK2 and c-Myc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p>
				<p>With highly compressed power, ultra short pulse durations, rapid rise times and high electric fields, nsPEF can penetrate into cell before plasma membrane is fully charged. Thus, nsPEF can minimally affect plasma membrane but target on subcellular structures, such as mitochondria and nuclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Alterations of membrane potential of subcellular structures could influence a series of signaling pathways, such as NF-κB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]and Wnt/β-Catenin signaling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], leading to extensive biological effects.</p>
				<p>Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a widely used thermal procedure that is reported to lead in many cases to incomplete tumor ablation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>], which is the result of a cooling or heat sink effect of nearby vessels, so the application of RFA should be considered problematic. However, as a non-thermal therapy, nsPEF can overcome the above disadvantages, which not only targets multiple programmed cell death mechanisms for apoptosis induction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and anti-angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], but also presents an apparent broad specificity for cell death induction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], effective for all cells within electric fields, including rapidly growing tumor cells, slower growing host cells that have been hijacked by tumors and cancer stem cells, all constituting the tumor mass and the microenvironment. Furthermore, nsPEF treatment can destroy tumor small vessel to induce local infarction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], which deprives tumors of feeder vessels that are important for immediate oxygenation and nutrition, and also have the potential for enhancing immune surveillance from cells undergoing apoptotic.</p>

It cannot only induce apoptosis in cancers cells via dependent-mitochondria intrinsic apoptosis pathway, but also inhibit cell proliferation through repressing NF-κB signaling pathway to reduce expressions of Cyclin proteins. Moreover, nsPEF can also inactivate metastasis and invasion in cancer cells by suppressing Wnt/β-Catenin signaling pathway to down-regulating expressions of VEGF and MMPs family proteins.
