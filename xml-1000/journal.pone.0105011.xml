<abstract>
<p>Pertussis is a highly infectious respiratory disease of humans caused by the bacterium <italic>Bordetella pertussis</italic>. Despite high vaccination coverage, pertussis has re-emerged globally. Causes for the re-emergence of pertussis include limited duration of protection conferred by acellular pertussis vaccines (aP) and pathogen adaptation. Pathogen adaptations involve antigenic divergence with vaccine strains, the emergence of strains which show enhanced <italic>in vitro</italic> expression of a number of virulence-associated genes and of strains that do not express pertactin, an important aP component. Clearly, the identification of more effective <italic>B. pertussis</italic> vaccine antigens is of utmost importance. To identify novel antigens, we used proteomics to identify <italic>B. pertussis</italic> proteins regulated by the master virulence regulatory system BvgAS <italic>in vitro</italic>. Five candidates proteins were selected and it was confirmed that they were also expressed in the lungs of naïve mice seven days after infection. The five proteins were expressed in recombinant form, adjuvanted with alum and used to immunize mice as stand-alone antigens. Subsequent respiratory challenge showed that immunization with the autotransporters Vag8 and SphB1 significantly reduced bacterial load in the lungs. Whilst these antigens induced strong opsonizing antibody responses, we found that none of the tested alum-adjuvanted vaccines - including a three-component aP - reduced bacterial load in the nasopharynx, suggesting that alternative immunological responses may be required for efficient bacterial clearance from the nasopharynx.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Pertussis (or whooping cough) is a highly contagious, acute respiratory disease of humans caused by the Gram-negative bacterium <italic>Bordetella pertussis</italic>. Although pertussis-related mortality has dropped significantly after the introduction of childhood vaccination, pertussis has resurged in many industrialized countries, with particularly large outbreaks occurring in 2010 and 2012 in Australia, the USA, the UK, the Netherlands, and several other countries <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105011-Boulton1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105011-Witt1">[4]</xref>. This increase in pertussis incidence is seen mainly in (vaccinated) adolescents and adults, providing a reservoir for transmission of pertussis to unvaccinated or partially vaccinated newborns, who are at greatest risk of developing severe pertussis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105011-Bisgard1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105011-Kowalzik1">[7]</xref>.</p>
<p>Although current pertussis vaccines are effective in limiting the development of severe clinical symptoms, they are much less effective in preventing colonization of the upper respiratory tract and consequently do not adequately reduce circulation in the population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105011-Warfel1">[8]</xref>. Moreover, vaccine-induced protection wanes rapidly leaving vaccinated individuals susceptible to develop disease after 5–7 years <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105011-Mooi1">[9]</xref>. The apparent inability of current vaccines to significantly reduce the circulation of <italic>B. pertussis</italic> may have facilitated pathogen adaptation. Pathogen adaptation has resulted in antigenic divergence between vaccine strains and circulating strains and the emergence of strains, designate P3 strains, which show enhanced <italic>in vitro</italic> expression of a number of virulence-associated genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105011-deGouw1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105011-Mooi2">[11]</xref>. Most recently, strains belonging to the P3 lineage have emerged which do not produce pertactin (Prn), a component of most aPs. Prn-deficient strains have reached frequencies of up to 55% in some countries <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105011-Barkoff1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105011-Pawloski1">[15]</xref>. Efforts to improve the immunogenicity of pertussis vaccines have thus far focused on skewing immunity towards more effective bacterial clearance, for instance through the use of novel adjuvants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105011-Polewicz1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105011-Ross1">[17]</xref>. However, the emergence of Prn-deficient strains also highlights a need to identify novel protective antigens, which may be included in improved aPs.</p>
<p>The expression of nearly all pertussis virulence factors, including the antigens present in aPs, is positively regulated by the two-component sensory transduction system BvgAS (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105011-Decker1">[18]</xref>). Bvg-activated proteins are generally associated with virulence and modulation or evasion of host immunity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105011-deGouw2">[19]</xref> and play an important, or even essential role, during infection. These proteins therefore represent potential vaccine targets. <italic>In vitro</italic>, low temperature and increasing concentration of nicotinic acid or sulfate are known to suppress the Bvg-system, resulting in the transition from virulent (Bvg<sup>+</sup>) through intermediate (Bvg<sup>i</sup>) to nonvirulent (Bvg<sup>−</sup>) bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105011-Melton1">[20]</xref>. In this study, we analyzed the Bvg<sup>+</sup>, Bvg<sup>i</sup>, and Bvg<sup>−</sup> phase-dependent protein content of two clinical isolates derived from the P1 and P3 lineages which dominated globally <italic>before</italic> and <italic>after</italic> the 1990s, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105011-Mooi2">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105011-Bart1">[21]</xref>. Conserved <italic>in vivo</italic> expressed candidates were then evaluated for their ability to confer protection against respiratory infection in mice.</p>

<p>The regulation of the Bvg-system is dependent on environmental signals, including free sulfate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105011-Melton1">[20]</xref>. In this study, we compared the proteome of two currently circulating <italic>B. pertussis</italic> lineages under <italic>in vitro</italic> Bvg<sup>+</sup> (low sulfate), Bvg<sup>i</sup> (medium sulfate), and Bvg<sup>−</sup> (high sulfate) conditions. <italic>B. pertussis</italic> strains B1917 and B1920 were used as representatives for the P3 and P1 lineages, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105011-Bart1">[21]</xref>. Bacterial cultures were grown in four replicates under different Bvg conditions, fractionated into cytosolic and membrane protein fractions and analyzed by mass spectrometry. This approach identified a total of 940 proteins in B1917 and 952 proteins in B1920, with 91% overlap between these strains (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0105011.s004">Text S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105011-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), representing ∼28% of the predicted 3449 protein-coding ORFs in the <italic>B. pertussis</italic> genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105011-Parkhill1">[22]</xref>. The IDEAL-Q algorithm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105011-Tsou1">[23]</xref> was used to identify proteins that were ≥2.5 fold higher expressed under Bvg<sup>+</sup> or Bvg<sup>i</sup> conditions compared to the Bvg<sup>−</sup> condition, which yielded 159 and 104 Bvg-activated proteins in B1917 and B1920, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0105011.s001">Table S1</xref>).</p>

<p>Since P3 and P1 strains both circulate in the population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105011-Bart2">[24]</xref>, novel antigens should target both lineages. We therefore first selected proteins that were Bvg-activated in both strains, resulting in 51 potential candidates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105011-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Aggregation based on function and predicted subcellular localization showed that these 51 candidates were significantly enriched for proteins involved in cellular processes (n = 6, 15%), outer membrane proteins (n = 6, 20%) and extracellular proteins (n = 10, 44%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105011-g001">Figure 1B and C</xref>). Subsequent selection based on Bvg-dependent <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105011-deGouw1">[10]</xref>, presence in the core genome of <italic>B. pertussis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105011-King1">[25]</xref> and predicted surface-exposed localization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105011-Yu1">[26]</xref> yielded 15 vaccine candidates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105011-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Of these 15 proteins, eight represent known <italic>B. pertussis</italic> protective antigens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105011-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), thus validating our strategy to identify virulence factors, some of which have proven immunogenic properties. Of the remaining candidates, the autotransporters SphB1 and Vag8, the TonB-dependent receptor for iron transport BfrD, the zinc protease BP2497, and the outer membrane porin protein Q (OmpQ), were selected for further examination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105011-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Although the outer membrane ligand binding protein BipA and FhaC are also promising vaccine candidates based on these criteria, their vaccine potential was not assessed due to limited resources.</p>
<p>The list of vaccine candidates was supplemented with proteins that were highly abundant under all Bvg conditions, as these may also represent attractive targets for the host immune response. Based on protein abundance estimation by emPAI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105011-Ishihama1">[27]</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0105011.s002">Table S2</xref>), the two most abundant proteins, outer membrane proteins A and P (OmpA, OmpP), were also selected for further analysis.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2b">
<title>Recombinant protein production and vaccination</title>
<p>To analyze the protective potential of the selected vaccine candidates, recombinant His-tagged fusion proteins were expressed, purified, and refolded. BfrD and OmpQ could not be produced due to low expression and protein degradation. The five remaining proteins were adjuvanted with alum (5 µg for each antigen, 1 µg for SphB1 due to low protein yield) and administered to BALB/c mice (six mice per group) as stand-alone antigens by subcutaneous injection at day 0 and 14. In parallel, groups of mice were vaccinated with a 3-component aP or with PBS and/or alum. Three weeks after the final vaccination, mice were challenged by intranasal infection with <italic>B. pertussis</italic> strain B1917. B1917 was chosen as the challenge strain, as it belongs to the predominant P3 lineage, which has spread worldwide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105011-Mooi2">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105011-Bart2">[24]</xref>. Importantly, the amino acid sequences of the tested antigens are highly conserved in all sequenced <italic>B. pertussis</italic> strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105011-Bart2">[24]</xref>.</p>
<p>aP-vaccinated mice showed the strongest (&gt;220-fold) reduction in bacterial load in the lungs at both 3 and 7 days after infection. Of the novel vaccine candidates, rOmpA did not confer any protection. Although vaccination with rOmpP and rBP2497 resulted in a small but significant reduction of bacterial numbers in the lungs at day 3 (1.7 and 1.8-fold, respectively), these differences were not observed at day 7, suggesting that these proteins have only limited vaccine potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105011-g002">Figure 2A and B</xref>). In contrast, vaccination with either rSphB1 or rVag8 resulted in a nearly 10-fold reduction in bacterial load in the lungs at day 3 and a more pronounced 26 and 68-fold reduction at day 7, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105011-g002">Figure 2A and B</xref>). Of note, although alum-vaccination induced a significant 7.3-fold reduction in bacterial load in the upper respiratory tract (URT) at day 7 compared to the PBS group, none of the vaccines, including aP, was able to reduce bacterial load in the URT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105011-g002">Figure 2C and D</xref>).</p>

<title>Antibody responses to vaccine antigens</title>
<p>To determine the potential role of antibodies in vaccine-mediated opsonization, ELISA was performed using sera from vaccinated mice. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105011-g003">Figure 3</xref> suggests that all vaccine candidates induced production of antigen-specific IgG. The absence of pre-existing antigen-specific antibodies was confirmed using pre-immune serum. To assess binding to native epitopes on the bacterial surface, flow cytometry was used to measure binding of antibodies in serum and nasal lavage to the challenge strain B1917 grown under Bvg<sup>+</sup> and Bvg<sup>−</sup> conditions. Serum antibodies from rVag8, rSphB1, and aP-vaccinated mice opsonized Bvg<sup>+</sup> bacteria at significant levels. Although opsonization levels were reduced for Bvg<sup>−</sup> bacteria, rVag8 and aP-vaccinated mice sera still bound significantly to Bvg<sup>−</sup> bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105011-g004">Figure 4A</xref>), which is most likely due to residual expression of these proteins under Bvg<sup>−</sup> conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0105011.s002">Table S2</xref>). For nasal lavage samples, binding to Bvg<sup>+</sup> bacteria was only detected for rVag8 and aP-treated animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105011-g004">Figure 4B</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The increase in pertussis outbreaks and the many adaptations observed in <italic>B. pertussis</italic> populations, including the down-regulation of Prn, indicates that more potent pertussis vaccines are warranted. Here, using an integrated ‘omics’ approach, we identified OmpP, OmpA, SphB1, Vag8, and BP2497 as <italic>in vivo</italic> expressed vaccine candidates. Stand-alone immunization with the autotransporters SphB1 and Vag8 induced significant protection against lower respiratory tract (LRT) infection, at a level which was only 10- and 3-fold lower compared to the reference 3-component aP vaccine (containing Ptx, Prn, and FHA), respectively. Thus far, four <italic>B. pertussis</italic> autotransporters have shown to confer protection in the mouse model, Prn <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105011-Roberts1">[29]</xref>, TcfA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105011-Sukumar1">[30]</xref>, SphB1, and Vag8, suggesting that these proteins represent an attractive class of protective antigens.</p>
<p>Since aluminum adjuvants typically induce a strong T helper type 2 (Th2) response and high levels of antibodies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105011-Stevens1">[31]</xref>, we primarily focused on the contribution of antibodies to protection. Although all five selected vaccine candidates induced significant levels of specific serum IgGs (predominantly IgG1), only rSphB1 and rVag8 conferred significant protection. A potential explanation for this result may be that only antibodies to rSphB1 and rVag8 opsonized <italic>B. pertussis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105011-g004">Figure 4</xref>). The inability of antibodies specific for rOmpP, rOmpA, and rBP2497 to successfully opsonize bacteria may be due to incorrect folding of the recombinant proteins, which is essential to induce bactericidal antibodies particularly to integral outer membrane proteins like OmpP and OmpA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105011-Nurminen1">[32]</xref>.</p>
<p>At present, the exact mechanisms of protection induced by SphB1 and Vag8 remain unknown. Antibodies to these proteins may facilitate phagocytosis and subsequent killing, or result in the deposition of complement factors on the bacterial surface. Alternatively, antibodies may neutralize the biological activity of these antigens. For instance, antibodies against Vag8 may enhance the susceptibility of <italic>B. pertussis</italic> to complement-mediated killing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105011-Marr1">[33]</xref>. Interestingly, SphB1 induced similar protection levels compared as Vag8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105011-g002">Figure 2</xref>), despite much lower opsonization levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105011-g004">Figure 4</xref>). This could be a direct consequence of the lower absolute expression levels of <italic>sphB1</italic> during infection compared to <italic>vag8</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105011-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Alternatively, the lower level of opsonizing antibodies may still be sufficient to effectively neutralize the biological activity of SphB1 on the bacterial surface. SphB1 is a serine protease which plays an essential role in the maturation of the adhesin and immune-modulating factor FHA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105011-Mazar1">[34]</xref>. Previous studies have shown that deletion of the <italic>sphB1</italic> gene dramatically attenuated the ability of <italic>B. pertussis</italic> to infect mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105011-Coutte1">[35]</xref> and enhanced phagocytosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105011-MobberleySchuman1">[36]</xref>. Taken together with our observation that <italic>sphB1</italic> is not expressed at high levels during infection, this gene represents a very attractive target because even low concentrations of neutralizing antibodies may be sufficient for protection.</p>
<p>Although we found that SphB1 and Vag8 were both expressed during infection in naïve mice, antibodies against these (recombinant) antigens were undetectable in convalescent pertussis patients (data not shown). Although it is possible that these proteins have poor intrinsic immunogenicity in humans during natural infection, another explanation may be that vaccinated individuals who are subsequently infected with <italic>B. pertussis</italic> preferentially respond to only a limited number of immunodominant vaccine antigens, also known as original antigenic sin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105011-Kim1">[37]</xref>.</p>
<p>Finally, an important observation was that none of the vaccine formulations, including aP, was able to reduce bacterial colonization of the URT. As colonization of the URT is probably essential for transmission, this may explain epidemiological studies which show that high circulation of <italic>B. pertussis</italic> occurs despite widespread aP vaccination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105011-deGreeff2">[38]</xref>. Similarly, recent observations in the baboon model have shown that aP-vaccinated baboons are protected against disease but remain susceptible to colonization and are able to transmit the disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105011-Warfel1">[8]</xref>. These data suggest that the immunological mechanisms which are required for effective clearance from the lungs (e.g. antibodies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105011-Kirimanjeswara1">[39]</xref>) are distinct from those in the URT, an observation which has also been made for other respiratory bacterial pathogens, including <italic>Streptococcus pneumonia</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105011-Malley1">[40]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105011-Zhang1">[42]</xref>. Cellular immunity in particular may represent an important component for effective clearance of the URT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105011-Lu1">[43]</xref> and in order to prevent both disease <italic>and</italic> colonization, a combined antibody and cellular response may be required <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105011-Warfel1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105011-Ross1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105011-Dunne1">[44]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0105011-Warfel2">[47]</xref>.</p>
