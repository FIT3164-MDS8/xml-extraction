<abstract>
<p>Changes in climate due to rising atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration ([CO<sub>2</sub>]) are predicted to intensify episodes of drought, but our understanding of how these combined conditions will influence crop-pathogen interactions is limited. We recently demonstrated that elevated [CO<sub>2</sub>] alone enhances maize susceptibility to the mycotoxigenic pathogen, <italic>Fusarium verticillioides</italic> (<italic>Fv</italic>) but fumonisin levels remain unaffected. In this study we show that maize simultaneously exposed to elevated [CO<sub>2</sub>] and drought are even more susceptible to <italic>Fv</italic> proliferation and also prone to higher levels of fumonisin contamination. Despite the increase in fumonisin levels, the amount of fumonisin produced in relation to pathogen biomass remained lower than corresponding plants grown at ambient [CO<sub>2</sub>]. Therefore, the increase in fumonisin contamination was likely due to even greater pathogen biomass rather than an increase in host-derived stimulants. Drought did not negate the compromising effects of elevated [CO<sub>2</sub>] on the accumulation of maize phytohormones and metabolites. However, since elevated [CO<sub>2</sub>] does not influence the drought-induced accumulation of abscisic acid (ABA) or root terpenoid phytoalexins, the effects elevated [CO<sub>2</sub>] are negated belowground, but the stifled defense response aboveground may be a consequence of resource redirection to the roots.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In 2015 the global average concentration of carbon dioxide ([CO<sub>2</sub>]) in the atmosphere reached a record high of 400 μmol CO<sub>2</sub> mol<sup>-1</sup> air and if current trends continue by the end of this century it could even surpass 800 μmol CO<sub>2</sub> mol<sup>-1</sup> air [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159270.ref001">1</xref>]. Rising [CO<sub>2</sub>] is largely responsible for changes in our climate including increased temperatures and altered precipitation patterns. These changes in weather patterns will ultimately influence crop productivity and are predicted to be particularly detrimental to summer crops, such as maize, which will likely experience severe episodes of drought. Maize (<italic>Zea mays</italic>) represents an essential part of the world’s grain food and feed supply, and the majority of the maize cropping systems depends on natural precipitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159270.ref002">2</xref>]. Maize uses the C<sub>4</sub> photosynthetic mechanism which is not limited by [CO<sub>2</sub>], and therefore, yields will only benefit from rising [CO<sub>2</sub>] under conditions of drought when the indirect effect of reduced stomatal conductance enhances the plants water-use efficiency allowing photosynthesis to continue despite limited water conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159270.ref003">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159270.ref005">5</xref>]. Nevertheless, in addition to abiotic stress, plant diseases and insect pests are also major limiting factors of maize productivity, yield, and quality; however, our understanding of how the combination of both elevated [CO<sub>2</sub>] and drought will affect maize susceptibility to biotic stressors is limited.</p>
<p>The mycotoxigenic fungal pathogen, <italic>Fusarium verticillioides</italic> (<italic>Fv</italic>) not only reduces the maize yield by causing rot in all parts of the plant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159270.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159270.ref007">7</xref>] but also produces carcinogenic polyketide-derived mycotoxins termed fumonisins which render harvested grain unsafe for human or animal consumption. Mycotoxins, such as fumonisins, are among the top food safety concerns with regard to climate change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159270.ref008">8</xref>] because environmental conditions predicted for the future are important factors that contribute to fumonisin contamination. Warmer temperatures increase evapotranspiration further intensifying drought which has been shown to correlate with <italic>Fv</italic> disease development and enhance fumonisin accumulation in grain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159270.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159270.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159270.ref010">10</xref>].</p>
<p>Recently, we demonstrated that elevated [CO<sub>2</sub>] (800 μmol CO<sub>2</sub> mol<sup>-1</sup> air) also enhances maize susceptibility to <italic>Fv</italic> infection, but the increase in fungal biomass did not correspond with greater fumonisin levels resulting in an overall reduction in fumonisin per unit fungal biomass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159270.ref011">11</xref>]. Following <italic>Fv</italic> inoculation, the accumulation of maize soluble sugars, free fatty acids, lipoxygenase (LOX) transcripts, jasmonic acid (JA) and salicylic acid (SA) phytohormones, and terpenoid phytoalexins was dampened at elevated [CO<sub>2</sub>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159270.ref011">11</xref>]. An influx of fatty acid substrate is essential for the burst of JA that initiates the defense signaling process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159270.ref012">12</xref>]. JA and other oxylipins are synthesized from free fatty acids through the LOX pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159270.ref013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159270.ref016">16</xref>]. The fatty acids are oxidized by LOX enzymes at either the 9 or 13 carbon position to produce 9-LOX or 13-LOX oxylipins, respectively. The phytohormone JA is a 13-LOX oxylipin derived from linolenic acid. The defense related functions of 9-LOX metabolites are not well characterized, but they have been implicated in the stimulation of mycotoxin production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159270.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159270.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159270.ref018">18</xref>]. Elevated [CO<sub>2</sub>] appears to effect both 9- and 13-LOX oxylipin biosynthesis at the level of fatty acid substrate supply and LOX-gene transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159270.ref011">11</xref>]. Lower concentrations of defensive phytochemicals, such as the zealexin and kauralexin terpenoid phytoalexins, due to compromised JA biosynthesis and signaling is consistent with increased <italic>Fv</italic> proliferation. Additionally, a dampened response of 9-LOX metabolites could reduce the ratio of fumonisin per <italic>Fv</italic> biomass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159270.ref011">11</xref>].</p>
<p>Elevated [CO<sub>2</sub>] similarly enhances C<sub>3</sub> crop (i.e. soybean, tomato) susceptibility to herbivory by compromising LOX-gene transcription, JA biosynthesis and JA-dependent antiherbivore defenses. However, in C<sub>3</sub> crops JA regulated defenses appeared to be compromised by an antagonistic boost in SA production, which does not occur in maize [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159270.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159270.ref019">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159270.ref021">21</xref>]. Furthermore, the effects of elevated [CO<sub>2</sub>] were negated when soybean plants were simultaneously exposed to drought stress.</p>
<p>Whether drought will negate the effects of elevated [CO<sub>2</sub>] on maize susceptibility to <italic>Fv</italic> is unknown, and it is unclear what the interactive effects of elevated [CO<sub>2</sub>] and drought will do to fumonisin levels. Although individual stress responses display measurable specificity, plants are frequently simultaneously challenged by several stress factors resulting in the activation of multiple signals that engage in cross-talk and alter individual responses. For example, abscisic acid (ABA), which typically functions in mediating responses against abiotic stress such as drought [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159270.ref022">22</xref>], can have a synergistic effect on JA. Furthermore, the induction of ABA with drought has been shown to promote resistance against some fungal pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159270.ref023">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159270.ref027">27</xref>]. However, if drought does not negate the effects of elevated [CO<sub>2</sub>] and fumonisin production is stimulated, future food safety issues could become more severe.</p>
<p>In this study we investigated the combined impact of elevated [CO<sub>2</sub>] and drought on maize susceptibility to <italic>Fv</italic> infection and fumonisin contamination using the maize stalk infection assay which we previously demonstrated to be representative of ear infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159270.ref011">11</xref>]. To evaluate the interactive effects of elevated [CO<sub>2</sub>] and drought on the maize defense response against <italic>Fv</italic>, we compared the concentration of carbohydrates, starch, proteins, free fatty acids, phytohormones, benzoxazinoids and terpenoid phytoalexins in both infected and control stalk tissues under individual and simultaneous abiotic stress treatments (elevated [CO<sub>2</sub>] and drought). Furthermore, since terpenoid phytoalexins were recently shown to accumulate in maize roots [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159270.ref028">28</xref>], we evaluated the effects of [CO<sub>2</sub>] on the accumulation of root terpenoid phytoalexins in response to drought. However, since it was initially unclear if the effects of elevated [CO<sub>2</sub>] on JA signaling persisted in the belowground tissues, the effects of elevated [CO<sub>2</sub>] and drought on the maize root defense response to <italic>Diabrotica balteata</italic> (rootworm) larval feeding was also evaluated. Finally, we discuss the potential implications of our findings on the future of maize grain security and safety under expected climate change conditions.</p>

<title>Experimental Design of <italic>F</italic>. <italic>verticillioides</italic> maize stalk inoculations</title>
<p>A total of 32 pots containing four <italic>Zea mays</italic> (maize) plants were grown in each of two environmental Conviron E15 (Pembina, ND, USA) growth chambers controlled at two different [CO<sub>2</sub>]: 400 μmol CO<sub>2</sub> mol<sup>-1</sup> air (1x[CO<sub>2</sub>]) and the other at 800 μmol CO<sub>2</sub> mol<sup>-1</sup> air (2x[CO<sub>2</sub>]). Using a complete randomized design in each chamber, a drought (-H<sub>2</sub>O) treatment was imposed on a subset of 16 pots at 25 d post by withholding water for 5 d. At 30 d post sowing, the +H<sub>2</sub>O and -H<sub>2</sub>O maize were inoculated by slitting the stem and injecting 100 μL of either a 1x10<sup>6</sup> <italic>F</italic>. <italic>verticillioides</italic> (<italic>Fv</italic>) (Northern Regional Research Laboratory [NRRL] stock no. 7415) spores mL<sup>-1</sup> (+<italic>Fv</italic>) or a control 0.1% Tween 20 solution (-<italic>Fv</italic>). Methods regarding preparation of fungal inoculum and stalk inoculation have previously been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159270.ref029">29</xref>]. Four biological replicates were designated and inoculated per treatment. Each biological replicate was composed of eight plants from two independent pots. Unless otherwise stated, the treated stem tissue was collected 2 d post inoculation by removing the area around the inoculation site. The experiment was repeated four times and the chambers were switched between repeated experiments. Comparisons between plant defense responses at 1x[CO<sub>2</sub>] and 2x[CO<sub>2</sub>] with irrigated (+H<sub>2</sub>O) have been published separately [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159270.ref011">11</xref>]. This manuscript focuses on the combined effects of elevated [CO<sub>2</sub>] and drought on maize susceptibility to <italic>Fv</italic> infection and fumonisin contamination in maize.</p>

<title>Plant material and growth conditions</title>
<p><italic>Zea mays</italic> var. <italic>Golden Queen</italic>, a sweet corn commonly grown for fresh market throughout Florida, (Southern States Cooperative, Inc., Richmond, VA, USA) was used for the reported experiments. Four plants were grown per pot (10.5 cm x 10.5 cm x 12 cm high), filled with MetroMix 200, (Sun Gro Horticulture Distribution, Inc, Bellevue, WA, USA) supplemented with 14-14-14 Osmocote (Scotts Miracle-Gro, Marysville, OH, USA). Other than the difference in [CO<sub>2</sub>], all other conditions of the growth chambers were identically controlled at 28°C day/25°C night, 500 μmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> photosynthetic photo flux density 12 h photoperiod and between 50 and 60% relative humidity. Environmental conditions were monitored and controlled as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159270.ref029">29</xref>]. The plants were watered daily and received bi-weekly nutrient supplement with soluble Peters 20-20-20 (The Scotts Company, Marysville, OH, USA). During the drought treatment, the irrigated (+H<sub>2</sub>O) plants received only water, no nutrient supplement.</p>

<title>Drought Treatment</title>
<p>A 5 d treatment of -H<sub>2</sub>O was chosen because it was the point at which maize plants at 1x[CO<sub>2</sub>] started to exhibit visually detectible drought stressed phenotypes such as leaf blade curling. Plants at 2x[CO<sub>2</sub>] still appeared relatively non-stressed. However, to verify that this was the point at which maize was benefitting from elevated [CO<sub>2</sub>] by increased water-use efficiency, the stomatal conductance for water vapor (g<sub>s</sub>), soil water content and photosynthetic CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rate (Pn) were measured. Stomatal conductance for CO<sub>2</sub>, g<sub>sc</sub> is g<sub>sc</sub> = g<sub>s</sub>/1.6. Only g<sub>s</sub> will be reported herein.</p>
<p>Gas exchange measurements for obtaining Pn and g<sub>s</sub> were taken with an open-flow portable leaf photosynthesis system (Li-Cor 6400XT, Li-Cor Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA) equipped with the standard leaf chamber (6 cm<sup>2</sup> of leaf area) and CO<sub>2</sub> injection system (model 6400–01, Li-Cor Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA) adjusted to a constant [CO<sub>2</sub>] of 400 μmol CO<sub>2</sub> mol air<sup>–1</sup> (1x[CO<sub>2</sub>]) or 800 μmol CO<sub>2</sub> mol air<sup>–1</sup>(2x[CO<sub>2</sub>]). The environmental conditions in the Li-Cor 6400 chamber were adjusted to match those of the growth chamber. Measurements were performed between 11:00 AM–1:00 PM on the fifth leaf from the bottom for four individual plants under each environmental condition.</p>
<p>Percentage of soil water content was measured using an EC-5 soil moisture sensor attached to the ProCheck sensor read-out system (Decagon Devices, Pullman, WA, USA) and verified using a gravimetric method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159270.ref030">30</xref>]. Fresh weight soil samples were collected from each pot with a 3 cm diameter cork borer. Four biological replicates consisting of a pool of soil samples from two pots were collected for each of the conditions. The samples were dried in an oven for 4 d at 60°C, the dry weight was recorded and the percent water content was calculated. The difference in water availability was not adjusted for equivalence because it was due to a natural physiological response to the climatic treatment.</p>

<p>The amount of pathogen DNA relative to plant DNA was estimated at 2 d and 7 d post inoculation using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) following methods previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159270.ref029">29</xref>]. In summary, a five-fold dilution series of pure <italic>Fv</italic> DNA and pure maize DNA was used to generate standard curves by plotting the Cq values obtained by RT-PCR against the log([DNA]) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159270.ref031">31</xref>].

<p>The Veratox fumonisin kit (Neogen, Lansing, MI, USA) and Veratox 3.0 for windows software was used to quantify the amount of fumonisin produced by <italic>Fv</italic> in maize stem tissue experiencing the abiotic stress treatments. The kit uses a direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to determine the total fumonisins (B1, B2, B3) between the quantization rage of 1 and 6 μg g<sup>−1</sup> and has been verified various grains including corn [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159270.ref032">32</xref>]. However, an additional validation was performed for maize stalk tissue by artificially contaminating samples with known quantities of fumonisins B1. The known quantity of fumonisin in a sample was plotted against the estimated quantity determined from using the kit. The r<sup>2</sup> value obtained from the standards provided by the kit was 0.997, and the r<sup>2</sup> value obtained from standards made in our lab mixed with maize stalk tissue was 0.956. Since the fumonisin levels were below detectable levels at 2 d post inoculation time point, the pathogen was allowed to establish for 7 d prior to analysis. For this longer treatment, drought was similarly imposed by withholding water for 5 d prior to application of pathogen, but 2 d after <italic>Fv</italic> inoculation (at which point the shorter 2 d experiment was terminated), the -H<sub>2</sub>O stressed plants were watered but then again water was withheld for the remainder of the experiment. As with the shorter experiment, four biological replicates consisting of a pool of eight stems were collected for analysis. Fumonisin was extracted from 0.25 g of ground tissue with 1 mL 70% methanol, diluted 5-fold and quantified following the kit manufacturers protocol.</p>

<title>Evaluation of maize root defense response</title>
<p>To evaluate the induction of root phytoalexins in response to drought, maize grown in potting mix was subjected to seven days of consecutive drought throughout which a subset of biological replicates were sacrificed for phytohormone analyses. As described above, drought treatment was imposed by withholding water. Each day at noon throughout the time course the soil volumetric water content (VWC) was measured using an EC-5 soil moisture sensor attached to the ProCheck sensor read-out system (Decagon Devices, Pullman, WA, USA), and the root mass of five biological replicates was collected.

<p>The generalist root herbivore of maize, <italic>Diabrotica balteata</italic> LeConte was used to assess differences in the root defense response to biotic stress under the variable abiotic stress conditions imposed.

Significant factors and interactions have been listed at the top right corner of figures which contain multiple comparisons. If there was no interaction between the potential contributing factors, a pair wise student’s t-test or ANOVA followed by Tukey- Kramer honestly significant difference (HSD) test was performed on mean of the main effects to determine which were significantly different. However, if there was a significant interaction between all the factors, a Tukey- Kramer honestly significant difference (HSD) test was performed to determine differences between interaction means. Because the main contributing factors were different depending on the variable being analyzed, statistical differences were not always indicated in the figure above each mean bar unless there was a significant interaction between all the factors and the ANOVA comparisons were made between interaction means.

<p>Elevated [CO<sub>2</sub>] reduces g<sub>s</sub> which can ameliorate drought stress by conserving water and enabling photosynthesis to continue for longer during episodes of drought [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159270.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159270.ref038">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159270.ref039">39</xref>]. To first confirm that the drought treatment imposed stress on both sets of plants but also exemplified the beneficial interactions between elevated [CO<sub>2</sub>] and drought, the g<sub>s</sub>, soil water content, and Pn were measured. There was a significant interaction between [CO<sub>2</sub>] and watering regime (H<sub>2</sub>O) for all three variables examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0159270.g001">Fig 1</xref>). The g<sub>s</sub> was approximately 60% lower in leaves of plants at 2x[CO<sub>2</sub>] in comparison to 1x[CO<sub>2</sub>]+H<sub>2</sub>O. Treatment of -H<sub>2</sub>O also reduced g<sub>s</sub> in plants at both [CO<sub>2</sub>], but as expected the reduction was much more severe at 1x[CO<sub>2</sub>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0159270.g001">Fig 1a</xref>). The soil moisture content was reduced at both [CO<sub>2</sub>], but the soil moisture content of -H<sub>2</sub>O stressed plants at 2x[CO<sub>2</sub>] was approximately 74% greater than corresponding plants as 1x[CO<sub>2</sub>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0159270.g001">Fig 1b</xref>).

Therefore, the imposed drought treatment was sufficient to stress both sets of plants, but also represent the physiological advantage provided by the interaction between elevated [CO<sub>2</sub>] and drought.

Both [CO<sub>2</sub>] and [CO<sub>2</sub>] x H<sub>2</sub>O were significant factors contributing to differences in ABA concentrations (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.01) presumably due to the variable level of drought stress in plants at 1x[CO<sub>2</sub>] and 2x[CO<sub>2</sub>], which is consistent with the amelioration of drought stress at 2x[CO<sub>2</sub>]. Additionally, <italic>Fv</italic> inoculation stimulated the production of ABA at both [CO<sub>2</sub>] suggesting that 2x[CO<sub>2</sub>] does not dampen the induction of ABA.</p>

<title>Elevated [CO<sub>2</sub>] and drought further dampened maize defense metabolism</title>
<p>The even greater susceptibility of maize to <italic>Fv</italic> proliferation at 2x[CO<sub>2</sub>]-H<sub>2</sub>O is consistent with a weaker response of important phytochemicals involved in resistance. Therefore, to evaluate the downstream impact of abiotic stress induced changes in phytohormone signaling, the concentrations of major maize defense metabolites were analyzed and compared.</p>
<p>Although the biologically inactive 2-(2,4-dihydroxy-7-methoxy-1,4-benzoxazin-3-one)-beta-D-glucopyranose (DIMBOA-Glc) and 2-(2-hydroxy-4,7-dimethoxy-1,4-benzoxazin-3-one)-beta-D-glucopyranose (HDMBOA-Glc) are synthesized during development and are primarily thought of as phytoanticipins, it has been suggested that JA is involved in the signal transduction leading to the conversion of DIMBOA-Glc into HDMBOA-Glc in response to pathogen attack [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159270.ref034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159270.ref043">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159270.ref044">44</xref>]. Therefore, compromised JA signaling could also influence this conversion. The interaction between [CO<sub>2</sub>] and H<sub>2</sub>O did not influence DIMBOA-Glc concentrations. However, independent of other treatments, [CO<sub>2</sub>], H<sub>2</sub>O and <italic>Fv</italic> did significantly reduce DIMBOA-Glc concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0159270.g007">Fig 7a</xref>). According to the ANOVA model, the concentration of HDMBOA-Glc was significantly influenced by the interaction between [CO<sub>2</sub>]xH<sub>2</sub>O (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0159270.g007">Fig 7b</xref>). But the slight reduction of HDMBOA-Glc in stems at 2x[CO<sub>2</sub>]+H<sub>2</sub>O was only marginally significant (<italic>P</italic> = 0.06) in comparison to concentrations 1x[CO<sub>2</sub>]+H<sub>2</sub>O using the Tukey-Kramer test.

<p>The unstable biologically active aglycones were not directly quantified, but the concentration of their degradation product MBOA was determined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0159270.g007">Fig 7c</xref>). With the exception of plants at 1x[CO<sub>2</sub>]-H<sub>2</sub>O, the concentration of MBOA was reduced with +<italic>Fv</italic>. The concentration of MBOA appeared to follow the inverse pattern of <italic>Fv</italic> biomass. The highest concentration of MBOA coincided with the least amount of pathogen in 1x[CO<sub>2</sub>]-H<sub>2</sub>O plants and the lower concentrations of MBOA coincided with the higher amounts of pathogen in plants at 2x[CO<sub>2</sub>]. However, 2x[CO<sub>2</sub>]-H<sub>2</sub>O+<italic>Fv</italic> plants which had the greatest amount of <italic>Fv</italic> biomass contained more MBOA then 2x[CO<sub>2</sub>]+H<sub>2</sub>O+<italic>Fv</italic>.</p>
<p>Although the accumulation of terpenoid phytoalexins was significantly influenced by the interaction between [CO<sub>2</sub>] and <italic>Fv</italic> at–H<sub>2</sub>O, the concentration of zealexins and kauralexins was greater in 2x[CO<sub>2</sub>]-H<sub>2</sub>O+<italic>Fv</italic> plants than in 1x[CO<sub>2</sub>]-H<sub>2</sub>O+<italic>Fv</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0159270.g008">Fig 8</xref>) which is opposite of what was observed in corresponding +H<sub>2</sub>O plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159270.ref011">11</xref>].

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our research has demonstrated that while the physiological effects of elevated [CO<sub>2</sub>] provide a photosynthetic advantage to maize under conditions of drought (-H<sub>2</sub>O), the plants are more susceptible to <italic>Fusarium verticillioides</italic> (<italic>Fv</italic>) proliferation and prone to higher levels of fumonisin contamination (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0159270.g001">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0159270.g002">2</xref>). Recent reviews have summarized the potential effects of future climate scenarios on the development of plant diseases and disease epidemics; however, there is a general consensus that relatively few studies have evaluated the interactive effects of multiple climate change factors on host-pathogen interactions, and further research is still required particularly with respect to mycotoxigenic pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159270.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159270.ref045">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159270.ref048">48</xref>]. This report represents an analysis of the interactive influence of elevated [CO<sub>2</sub>] and drought on maize phytochemical defense responses to an economically important mycotoxigenic pathogen. Our findings provide insight into climate change induced host metabolic alterations that lead to variation in crop susceptibility and mycotoxin contamination.</p>
<p>The majority of studies investigating the effects of climate change on plant defense are on C<sub>3</sub> plants and plant-herbivore interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159270.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159270.ref049">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159270.ref050">50</xref>]. Emerging results suggest that abiotic stress can modulate phytohormone signals leading to differential responses to biotic stress, variation in downstream defense chemistry, and changes in susceptibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159270.ref050">50</xref>]. This is consistent with our findings in C<sub>4</sub> maize both the defense response to <italic>Fv</italic> stem inoculation and <italic>Db</italic> root feeding was altered by the abiotic stress treatments (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0159270.g002">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0159270.g010">10</xref> and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159270.ref011">11</xref>]). However, the dampened response of JA regulated defenses and increase in SA regulated defenses in C<sub>3</sub> plants under elevated [CO<sub>2</sub>] are negated in combination with drought [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159270.ref019">19</xref>].</p>
<p>In maize, the accumulation of both JA and SA is compromised under elevated [CO<sub>2</sub>] and these effects persist even in combination with drought (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0159270.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Therefore, aboveground the effects of elevated [CO<sub>2</sub>] supersede any potential stimulation of JA defenses with -H<sub>2</sub>O (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0159270.g006">Fig 6a</xref> and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159270.ref051">51</xref>]). The initial induction of JA following <italic>Fv</italic> inoculation was stronger in -H<sub>2</sub>O stressed plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0159270.g006">Fig 6a</xref>) in comparison to +H<sub>2</sub>O plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159270.ref011">11</xref>]; however, this stimulation did not last (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0159270.g005">Fig 5a</xref>). Other literature reports also suggest that, on its own, drought does not adequately stimulate JA defenses in aboveground maize tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159270.ref052">52</xref>]. Therefore, the mechanism of phytohormone modulation by which elevated [CO<sub>2</sub>] and drought alters defenses in C<sub>4</sub> maize is different from those previously described for C<sub>3</sub> plants (i.e. soybean) and require additional research so that strategies can be developed to ensure the quality and safety of the future maize crop under climate change scenarios.</p>
<p>The increase in maize susceptibility to <italic>Fv</italic> proliferation suggests a compromised defense response. Consistent with this notion, the initial induction of JA and SA phytohormones was dampened at 2x[CO<sub>2</sub>]-H<sub>2</sub>O in comparison to 1x[CO<sub>2</sub>]-H<sub>2</sub>O (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0159270.g006">Fig 6</xref>). In comparison to 2x[CO<sub>2</sub>]+H<sub>2</sub>O plants though [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159270.ref011">11</xref>], JA levels of 2x[CO<sub>2</sub>]-H<sub>2</sub>O plants were only slightly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0159270.g006">Fig 6</xref>). An even weaker JA signal should have resulted in reduced accumulation of zealexins and kauralexins. Although terpenoid phytoalexin concentrations were greater in infected plants at 2x[CO<sub>2</sub>]-H<sub>2</sub>O in comparison to 1x[CO<sub>2</sub>]-H<sub>2</sub>O (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0159270.g008">Fig 8</xref>), it is important to consider that the accumulation of these phytoalexins has been shown to be dependent on the amount of pathogen inoculum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159270.ref034">34</xref>]. Therefore, while the reduction in pathogen biomass could account for the corresponding reduction in terpenoid phytoalexins at 1x[CO<sub>2</sub>]-H<sub>2</sub>O in comparison to 1x[CO<sub>2</sub>]+H<sub>2</sub>O, the concentration of both zealexin and kauralexin metabolites could be further induced in 2x[CO<sub>2</sub>]-H<sub>2</sub>O plants, which had significantly more pathogen biomass. Nevertheless, despite the potential augmented induction of plants at 2x[CO<sub>2</sub>]-H<sub>2</sub>O+<italic>Fv</italic> in comparison to 2x[CO<sub>2</sub>]+H<sub>2</sub>O+<italic>Fv</italic>, only the concentration of kauralexins was significantly less while the concentration of zealexins remained unchanged. However since the pathogen biomass was greater, the accumulation of zealexins was likely also compromised at 2x[CO<sub>2</sub>]-H<sub>2</sub>O in comparison to 2x[CO<sub>2</sub>]+H<sub>2</sub>O.</p>
<p>The redirection of resources to maize roots may have contributed to the weaker response of terpenoid phytoalexins leading to intensified aboveground susceptibility to <italic>Fv</italic> proliferation between +H<sub>2</sub>O and -H<sub>2</sub>O plants at 2x[CO<sub>2</sub>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0159270.g008">Fig 8</xref> and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159270.ref011">11</xref>]). The 20 carbon diterpenoid kauralexins require more resources and accumulate to higher concentrations than the 15 carbon sesquiterpenoid zealexins in -H<sub>2</sub>O stressed maize roots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0159270.g009">Fig 9</xref> and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159270.ref028">28</xref>]). This could potentially explain the greater effect on kauralexin levels in maize stems in comparison to zealexin levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0159270.g008">Fig 8</xref> and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159270.ref011">11</xref>]). Although JA was also reduced in maize roots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0159270.g010">Fig 10a</xref>) and the accumulation of terpenoid phytoalexins in response to <italic>Diabrotica balteata</italic> larval feeding was impaired under conditions of 2x[CO<sub>2</sub>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0159270.g010">Fig 10b and 10c</xref>), ABA signaling was unaffected (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0159270.g005">5c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0159270.g009">9c</xref>) and the accumulation of drought induced terpenoid phytoalexins was not inhibited (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0159270.g009">9b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0159270.g010">10b and 10c</xref>). This is consistent with previous results demonstrating that application of ABA was sufficient to induce the accumulation of maize root zealexins and kauralexins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159270.ref028">28</xref>]. Consequently, in contrast to aboveground tissues, -H<sub>2</sub>O induced ABA in maize roots can counterbalance the compromising effects of 2x[CO<sub>2</sub>] on the accumulation of zealexins and kauralexins. Therefore, at least with respect to root terpenoid phytoalexins, drought does negate the effects of elevated 2x[CO<sub>2</sub>].</p>
<p>Glycosylated benzoxazinoid concentrations were also influenced by the abiotic stress treatments; however, these changes do not appear to be correlated with increased susceptibility to <italic>Fv</italic> under conditions of 2x[CO<sub>2</sub>]+H<sub>2</sub>O or 2x[CO<sub>2</sub>]-H<sub>2</sub>O. The decrease in DIMBOA-Glc and corresponding increase in HDMBOA-Glc following <italic>Fv</italic> inoculation, which has previously been reported with <italic>F</italic>. <italic>graminearum</italic> maize stem infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159270.ref053">53</xref>], was not inhibited by 2x[CO<sub>2</sub>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0159270.g007">Fig 7a and 7b</xref>). The DIMBOA-Glc 4-O-methyltransferase which converts DIMBOA-Glc to HDMBOA-Glc is thought to be regulated by JA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159270.ref043">43</xref>], but HDMBOA-Glc can also accumulate <italic>de novo</italic> in response to pathogen attack [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159270.ref054">54</xref>]. Moreover, even the compromised JA signal was adequate to stimulate HDMBOA-Glc accumulation. In contrast, drought considerably reduced the concentration of HDMBOA-Glc. Benzoxazinoids are suspected to be involved in drought stress tolerance because drought or belowground application of ABA can induce the concentration of DIMBOA in maize leaves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159270.ref033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159270.ref055">55</xref>]. Although the highly reactive aglycones were not quantified in this study, DIMBOA concentrations likely increased in maize stalks with drought and may have partly contributed to the reduction in pathogen biomass at 1x[CO<sub>2</sub>]-H<sub>2</sub>O. DIMBOA-Glc levels on the other hand may not be significantly altered as previously shown for ABA treated plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159270.ref056">56</xref>] which is consistent with our results. <italic>Fv</italic> is highly resistant to MBOA and has the ability to detoxify the compound by actively metabolizing it into <italic>N</italic>-(2-hydroxy-4-methoxyphenyl) malonamic acid (HMPMA) which is nontoxic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159270.ref057">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159270.ref058">58</xref>]. Consistent with <italic>Fv</italic> detoxification of MBOA, the concentration of MBOA tended to inversely track pathogen biomass. However, this did not hold true at 2x[CO<sub>2</sub>] between +H<sub>2</sub>O and -H<sub>2</sub>O plants which would suggest additional interactive effects of 2x[CO<sub>2</sub>] and -H<sub>2</sub>O on benzoxazinoids metabolism. Further research investigating the effects of multiple climate change factors on maize benzoxazinoids and their derivatives in interaction with a pathogen more sensitive to these defense metabolites (i.e. <italic>Fusarium graminearum</italic>) will be necessary to fully understand the potential implications of the abiotic stress induced changes in maize benzoxazinoid dominated defenses.</p>
<p>Although the fumonisin contamination was significantly higher in infected stems under simultaneous conditions of 2x[CO<sub>2</sub>] and -H<sub>2</sub>O, the amount of fumonisin per unit <italic>Fv</italic> biomass was reduced compared to +<italic>Fv</italic> maize at 1x[CO<sub>2</sub>]. These data are consistent with previous results indicating that elevated [CO<sub>2</sub>] compromises the transcriptional response of many of the 9- and 13-lipoxygenase (LOX) and their signaling products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159270.ref011">11</xref>], which have the potential to stimulate mycotoxin production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159270.ref059">59</xref>]. Even though the transcript levels of LOX genes were not measured in this study, the metabolite analysis supports this notion. The addition of drought did not ameliorate the effects of elevated [CO<sub>2</sub>] on the influx of fatty acid substrate needed for oxylipin biosynthesis, nor did it negate the dampened accumulation of the 13-LOX oxylipin JA following <italic>Fv</italic> infection (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0159270.g004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0159270.g006">6</xref>). Nevertheless, even though host-derived mycotoxin stimulants are potentially still reduced, the even larger amount of <italic>Fv</italic> biomass on maize at 2x[CO<sub>2</sub>]-H<sub>2</sub>O was ample to lead to greater fumonisin levels and could therefore be an agriculturally relevant food safety concern.</p>
<p>Considering that the drought treatment imposed in these experiments was specifically designed to account for the physiological changes in water utilization at 2x[CO<sub>2</sub>], it is possible that, in comparison to a more moderate drought stress treatment at 1x[CO<sub>2</sub>], the amount of fumonisin contamination would be higher instead of lower. Numerous reports indicate that drought enhances maize susceptibility to <italic>Fv</italic> and fumonisin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159270.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159270.ref060">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159270.ref061">61</xref>]; however, in these experiments at 1x[CO<sub>2</sub>]-H<sub>2</sub>O plants displayed both less <italic>Fv</italic> biomass and fumonisin compared to irrigated plants. Since maize utilizes more water at 1x[CO<sub>2</sub>] and the degree of drought stress was higher (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0159270.g001">Fig 1b</xref>), the percentage of water in the stem tissues was significantly less (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0159270.g003">Fig 3a</xref>). Therefore, it is likely that this lower water activity was not conducive to fungal growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159270.ref062">62</xref>] and reduced <italic>Fv</italic> biomass and fumonisin production. While normalizing for soil moisture content would provide additional insight into the effects of [CO<sub>2</sub>] at variable levels of drought, this is beyond the scope of the current manuscript. The difference in soil water content was a consequence of the plant’s physiological response to elevated [CO<sub>2</sub>] which was a factor being studied and was thus intentionally not controlled in these experiments. Elevated [CO<sub>2</sub>] has the potential to ameliorate the severity of drought; therefore, it is essential to understand how these abiotic factors will interact and influence <italic>Fv</italic> infection in comparison to conditions which will not receive this same benefit of water conservation. Timing of infection will likely also play an important role in fumonisin contamination levels as during episodes of drought maize at 2x[CO<sub>2</sub>] may also provide a more favorable environment for pathogen growth, allowing for a prolonged period of mycotoxin accumulation. Furthermore, while the chamber based studies provide valuable data in understanding the defense response under controlled conditions of biotic stress, there are multiple limitations including light intensity, breadth of spectral wavelength, and hindered root establishment. These factors likely contribute to the abiotic stress imposed and influence resource availability and distribution. Additional laboratory studies coupled with field based free air gas concentration enrichment (FACE) experiments are needed to determine the tradeoffs between the photosynthetic advantage of water conservation and increased susceptibility on maize grain productivity during simultaneous conditions of elevated [CO<sub>2</sub>] and drought. Nonetheless, given the heightened climate change concerns and the potential consequences of our uncertainties for future agricultural maize production, our findings have provided a foundation for additional research necessary for the development of climate resilient mycotoxin control strategies.</p>
