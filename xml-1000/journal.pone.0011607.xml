<title>Background</title>
<p>DCB-3503, a tylophorine analog, inhibits the growth of PANC-1 (human pancreatic ductal cancer cell line) and HepG2 (human hepatocellular cancer cell line) tumor xenografts in nude mice. The inhibition of growth leads to cancer cell differentiation instead of cell death. However, the mechanisms of action of tylophorine analogs is unknown.</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title>
<p>In this study, we show that DCB-3503 suppresses the expression of pro-oncogenic or pro-survival proteins with short half-lives, including cyclin D1, survivin, β-catenin, p53, and p21, without decreasing their mRNA levels. Proteasome inhibitor reversed the inhibitory effect of DCB-3503 on expression of these proteins. DCB-3503 inhibited the incorporation of radiolabeled amino acid and thymidine, and to a much lesser degree of uridine, in a panel of cell lines. The mechanism of inhibition of protein synthesis is different from that of cycloheximide (CHX) as assayed in cell culture and HeLa <italic>in vitro</italic> translation system. Furthermore, in contrast to rapamycin, DCB-3503 does not affect protein synthesis through the mTOR pathway. DCB-3503 treatment shifts the sedimentation profiles of ribosomes and mRNAs towards the polysomal fractions while diminishing monosome abundance, indicative of the inhibition of the elongation step of protein synthesis. Preferential down regulation of several studied proteins under these conditions is likely due to the relative short half-lives of these proteins.</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>Conclusion/Significance</title>
<p>The inhibitory effect of DCB-3503 on translation is apparently distinct from any of the current anticancer compounds targeting protein synthesis. Translation inhibitors with novel mechanism could complement current chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of human cancers and suppress the occurrence of drug resistance.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>

<p>The details of the mechanisms of action of tylophorine analogs against cancer remain largely unknown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011607-Chopra1">[1]</xref>. Our previous structure-activity relationship studies revealed that these analogs would have the same mechanism of action <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011607-Gao3">[8]</xref>. The most potent analog, DCB-3503, had a potent inhibitory effect on NF-κB and less effect on cyclic AMP response elements (CREs) and activator protein-1 sites (AP-1)-mediated transcriptions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011607-Gao1">[5]</xref>. DCB-3503 could also down-regulate a subset of proteins, including cyclin D1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011607-Shiah1">[6]</xref>. In the present study, we chose several pro-oncogenic and pro-survival proteins, including cyclin D1, survivin, β-catenin, p53, and p21 as model proteins to examine the inhibition effects of DCB-3503 on translation, particularly focusing on cyclin D1. House keeping gene products like β-actin and tubulin are encoded by mRNAs with short and unstructured untranslated regions (UTRs) that are rarely modified. While proto-oncoproteins like cyclin D1 and pro-survival factors like survivin are encoded by mRNAs with long and highly structured UTRs that can be controlled at multiple levels. For example, the expression of cyclin D1, survivin, and β-catenin can be translationally regulated through the AU rich elements in the 3'UTR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011607-MertensTalcott1">[9]</xref>. Cyclin D1 expression can also be controlled by the PI3K/Akt/mTOR/p70S6K signaling pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011607-Lee1">[10]</xref>. Understanding the mode of regulatory effect of DCB-3503 on these proteins could help reveal the mechanisms of action of tylophorine analogs.</p>
<p>The current study revealed a novel activity of DCB-3503, which is directed against synthesis of a subset of cell regulatory proteins. This mode of action is distinct from any other known anticancer drugs. Based on our current findings and previous reports of the unique structures, mode of actions, anticancer activities independent of MDR-1 and MRP-1, tylophorine analogs have great potential as a new class of anticancer drugs.</p>

<title>DCB-3503 suppresses the expression of a subset of proteins</title>
<p>The expression of cylcin D1, survivin, β-catenin, p53, and p21 were down-regulated by DCB-3503 in a time- and dose-dependent manner in HepG2 cells using Western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011607-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). In contrast, the expression of cyclin E and β-actin did not significantly change under the same conditions. Cyclin D1 was down-regulated as early as 15 minutes after treatment with 300 nM DCB-3503 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011607-g001">Fig. 1B left panel</xref>, compare Lane 2 and Lane 1), and its expression was suppressed extensively by as low as 50 nM DCB-3503 treatment for 2 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011607-g001">Fig. 1B right panel</xref>, compare Lane 2 and Lane 1). DCB-3503 induced down-regulation of cyclin D1, survivin, and β-catenin in the same fashion in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011607-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). The down-regulatory effect of DCB-3503 on p53 and p21 in HeLa cells was difficult to evaluate due to the low endogenous level of these proteins (data not shown). The time- and dose-dependent suppression of cyclin D1 induced by DCB-3503 treatment was also observed in Huh7 and MCF-7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011607-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>). Therefore, the down-regulatory effect of DCB-3503 on proto-oncoprotein cyclin D1 is not cell type-specific. This is in agreement with our previous findings that DCB-3503 down-regulated cyclin D1 in HepG2, and PANC-1 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011607-Shiah1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011607-Gao2">[7]</xref>.</p>

<title>DCB-3503 does not decrease mRNA levels of the suppressed proteins</title>
<p>To analyze the underlying mechanism of DCB-3503 suppressed protein expression, we first assessed whether DCB-3503 could affect mRNA levels of these proteins using real-time PCR analysis. DCB-3503 caused a steady increase to about 2 fold in mRNA levels of cyclin D1 and p53 during the first 8-hour of treatment and then tapered off to the untreated control level by 24 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011607-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). DCB-3503 exhibited little effect on mRNA levels of survivin, β-catenin, and p21 through out the treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011607-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). The increase in mRNA level could be due to the compensatory regulation of cyclin D1 and p53 proteins. In contrast, CHX significantly increased mRNA levels of cyclin D1 and p21 after 24 hours treatment, but did not alter mRNA levels of other proteins studied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011607-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). Northern blot analysis revealed that cyclin D1 mRNA level was increased by DCB-3503 after 2-hour treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011607-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). The 4.8 kb and 1.7 kb RNA transcripts of cyclin D1, which have the same coding sequence but differ in polyadenylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011607-Xiong1">[16]</xref>, remained unchanged after treatment with DCB-3503. Thus, DCB-3503 suppression of protein accumulation cannot be due to the decrease of mRNA levels. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that the unchanged transcripts of cyclin D1 mRNA are due to the compensation of the inhibitory effect of DCB-3503 on cyclin D1 expression.</p>

<title>DCB-3503 dose not increase the degradation of proteins with short half-lives</title>
<p>We next examined whether DCB-3503 treatment could induce degradation of cyclin D1, survivin, β-catenin, p53, and p21. CHX blocks peptidyl transferase activity in eukaryotic ribosomes, and it was used to stop protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells for the estimation of the half-life. We found that the half-life of cyclin D1 in HepG2 cells is relatively short (&lt;0.5 hour) as compared to that of β-actin (&gt;4 hours, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011607-g002">Fig. 2C, right panel</xref>). The half-lives of other proteins in the presence of CHX was determined to be in the order of survivin ≥β-catenin &gt; p53 &gt; cyclin D1 ≥ p21. We next assessed whether the combined treatment of CHX and DCB-3503 could enhance the suppression of the cell regulatory proteins we examined, compared to CHX treatment alone. The intensities of the bands of these proteins were quantified using a densitometer, and normalized to that of β-actin and marked below each band (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011607-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). When CHX was present, there was no detectable difference in the kinetics of decay of cyclin D1, survivin, β-catenin, p53, and p21 in the presence or absence of DCB-3503 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011607-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). Pre-exposure of HepG2 cells to 2 µM MG-132, a proteasome inhibitor, following the addition of DCB-3503 reversed the suppression of cyclin D1, survivin, β-catenin, p53, and p21 by DCB-3503 treatment within 4 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011607-g002">Fig. 2D</xref> <italic>a</italic>). However, MG-132 at 2 µM cannot abolish the cytotoxicity of DCB-3503 after 24-hour treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011607-g002">Fig. 2D</xref> <italic>b</italic>). Higher concentration of MG-132 (10 µM) caused cell death in the presence or absence of DCB-3503 with overnight culture (data not shown). Taken together, these results indicate that DCB-3503 does not increase the rate of degradation of this subset of proteins.</p>

<title>DCB-3503 inhibits amino acid incorporation in a time- and dose-dependent manner</title>
<p>The above results indicated that DCB-3503 suppresses cell regulatory proteins at the translational level. We therefore measured global changes of protein synthesis in response to DCB-3503 treatment. A time course of [<sup>3</sup>H]-amino acid incorporation into proteins is affected by DCB-3503 as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011607-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>. At 100 nM, DCB-3503 inhibited [<sup>3</sup>H]-amino acid incorporation as early as by 15 minutes of treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011607-g003">Fig. 3A <italic>a</italic></xref>). This inhibition was DCB-3503 dose-dependent but not cell type specific, as observed in HeLa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011607-g003">Fig. 3B <italic>a</italic></xref>) and PANC-1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011607-g003">Fig. 3B <italic>b</italic></xref>). DCB-3503 treatment inhibited [<sup>3</sup>H]-amino acid incorporation by 50% at 100 nM, whereas 100 µg/ml of CHX totally blocked it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011607-g003">Fig. 3A <italic>a</italic></xref>). This could imply an enhanced susceptibility to DCB-3503 mediated inhibition for a subset of proteins. In addition, suppression of global protein synthesis by DCB-3503 was revealed by [<sup>35</sup>S]-methionine/cysteine incorporation assay in HepG2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011607-g003">Fig. 3C, left panel</xref>). The amount of newly synthesized cyclin D1 protein in DCB-3503 treated HepG2 cells was assessed by immunoprecipitation with an anti-cyclin D1 antibody of [<sup>35</sup>S]-labeled proteins. There was a reduction in the amount of radioactivity in a major immunoprecipitable polypeptide that corresponds to cyclin D1 at 300 nM as established by immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011607-g003">Fig. 3C, right panels</xref>).

<title>DCB-3503 acts differently from CHX and rapamycin</title>
<p>Translation efficiency is positively regulated by the 5′ cap structure and the 3′ poly(A) tail. We therefore used capped luciferase mRNA with or without poly(A) tail to program HeLa cell-free extracts. The addition of 1 µM DCB-3503 produced about 50% inhibitory effect on translation of both non-polyadenylated and polyadenylated luciferase mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011607-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>). CHX completely blocked translation of T3 luciferase mRNA <italic>in vitro</italic>. The mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin, had no inhibitory effect on translation of either type of mRNA under the same conditions. Western blot results showed DCB-3503 elevated phosphorylations of p70 S6 kinase, 4E-BP1 at Ser<sup>65</sup> and Thr<sup>37/46</sup> sites, and had no effect on phosphorylation of S6 ribosomal after 2-hour treatment in HepG2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011607-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>). In contrast, rapamycin completely inhibited phosphorylation of p70 S6 kinase (Thr<sup>389</sup>) and reduced phosphorylated S6 ribosomal protein (Ser<sup>235/236</sup>) level to about 50% of untreated control under the same condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011607-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>). Rapamycin only suppressed phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 at Ser<sup>65</sup>, which can inhibit cap-dependent translation downstream of mTOR by inhibiting the rate-limiting translational initiator eIF4E <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011607-Gingras1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011607-Brunn1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011607-Gingras2">[24]</xref>.

<title>DCB-3503 induces changes in polysome profile and mRNA distribution</title>
<p>To further characterize the effects of DCB-3503 on translation, we compared polysome profiles of DCB-3503 or CHX-treated HepG2 and HeLa cells to untreated control cells. DCB-3503 increased the abundance of polysomes at the expense of monosomes, with heavy polysomes being relatively more affected than light polysomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011607-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>). Such an effect on the polysome profile is a hallmark of inhibition of elongation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011607-Mathews1">[25]</xref>. CHX treatment stabilized polysomes in both HepG2 and HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011607-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>). We then analyzed distribution of mRNAs of cyclin D1, survivin, β-catenin, and β-actin in the sucrose gradient fractions from HepG2 cells using real-time PCR. DCB-3503 induced sedimentation shift of all these mRNAs to the non-translation proficient polysome fractions of the gradient in a time- and dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011607-g006">Fig. 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0011607.s002">Fig. S2</xref>). The increased accumulation of cyclin D1, survivin, β-catenin, and β-actin mRNAs in the polysome fractions is consistent with the inhibition of the elongation step of translation by DCB-3503.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study demonstrates that cyclin D1 protein could be down-regulated as early as 15 minutes after DCB-3503 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011607-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). In contrast, availability of cyclin D1 mRNA remain unchanged under similar condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011607-g002">Fig. 2A and B</xref>). We also found that DCB-3503 treatment suppressed the expression of cyclin D1, survivin, β-catenin, p53, and p21. Combined treatment of DCB-3503 and CHX did not further decrease the half-lives of these proteins as compared to the treatment with CHX alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011607-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). Treatment of DCB-3503 inhibited the incorporation of [<sup>3</sup>H]- or [<sup>35</sup>S]-amino acid into proteins as measured in HepG2, HeLa, and PANC-1 cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011607-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). In addition, we observed that DCB-3503 preferentially suppressed the rate of [<sup>14</sup>C]-thymidine incorporation into DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011607-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>), but this could be a secondary event following the down-regulation of a subset of cellular proteins involved in DNA synthesis. Xi et al reported an alternative possibility that tylophorine analogs can interact with bulged DNA directly, and then interfere with DNA synthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011607-Xi1">[26]</xref>. However, we were unable to demonstrate that DCB-3503 interacts with DNA using ethidium displacement analysis (data not shown).</p>
<p>A variety of antitumor agents suppress transcription and/or translation of cyclin D1; these include retinoic acid, rapamycin, LY294002, wortmannin, herbimycin A, and geldanamycin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011607-Dong1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011607-Ma1">[28]</xref>. Additionally, inhibitors of translational elongation like homoharringtonine, bruceantin, and didemnin B, can also inhibit expression of cyclin D1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011607-Robert1">[29]</xref>. These compounds down-regulate cyclin D1 expression through different mechanisms. Retinoic acid induces proteasomal degradation of cyclin D1 and exhibits no effect on cyclin D1 mRNA level. GSK3 plays a key role in retinoid regulation of cyclin D1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011607-Ma1">[28]</xref>. Rapamycin, a well-known mTOR inhibitor, suppresses initiation of cyclin D1 mRNA translation through inhibition of the mTOR-ribosomal p70 S6 kinase and mTOR-eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein-1 (eIF4E) pathways. In addition, rapamycin-stimulated activation of GSK3β leads to a decrease in the half-life of cyclin D1 and induction of cyclin D1 proteolysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011607-Dong1">[27]</xref>. Differential inhibition of cyclin D1 expression by PI3K inhibitors, LY294002, and wortmannin, is mediated through differential inhibition of p70 S6 kinase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011607-Adi1">[30]</xref>. Herbimycin A, a potent tyrosine kinase inhibitor, down-regulates cyclin D1 protein by suppressing synthesis of its mRNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011607-Yamada1">[31]</xref>. Geldanamycin, a potent heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) inhibitor, can induce cyclin D1 down-regulation through suppression of mTOR signaling pathway by disrupting the <italic>in vivo</italic> binding of HSP90 with mTOR raptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011607-Nomura1">[32]</xref>.

The action of DCB-3503 on inhibition of protein translation is distinct from that of the above-mentioned compounds, and is apparently operating at the elongation phase of translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011607-g006">Fig. 6</xref>).</p>
<p>Huang et al reported that 100 µM of tylocrebrine inhibited protein synthesis during chain elongation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011607-Huang1">[17]</xref>; Grant et al reported that 130 µM of cryptopeurine inhibited protein synthesis in the translocation phase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011607-Grant1">[36]</xref>. These concentrations were far above the relevant concentration we studied (100 nM, 300 nM or maximum 1 µM, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011607-g005">Fig. 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011607-g006">6</xref>). The structures of the above two tylophorine analogs are different from DCB-3503. These structure analogs of tylophorine may not be functional analogs, as we demonstrated previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011607-Gao3">[8]</xref>. The high cytotoxicity of DCB-3503 may also be due to its inhibition of elongation phase in translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011607-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). Translation elongation inhibitors can sensitize chemotherapeutic agents <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011607-Robert1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011607-Sah1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011607-Budihardjo1">[38]</xref>. Additionally, inhibition on translation elongation can overcome drug resistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011607-Wu1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011607-SchneiderPoetsch1">[40]</xref>. One possibility is that the proto-oncoproteins and pro-survival factors exhibit higher translation rates in cancer cells, and inhibition of all mRNAs elongation will turn out to have more profound effect on mRNAs of these proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011607-Sunters1">[41]</xref>. Alternatively, proto-oncoproteins and pro-survival factors have relatively short half-lives, and are more likely to be depleted by inhibition of elongation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011607-Robert1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011607-Weinstein1">[42]</xref>.</p>
<p>We observed partial inhibitory effect on translation with 1 µM DCB-3503 in Hela cell extracts system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011607-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>), which is less effective dosage on cell based studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011607-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). Intracellular regulators that control elongation may be only partially operative in <italic>in vitro</italic> translation systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011607-Wang1">[43]</xref>. Such factors can be elongation factors, or recently actively studied miRNAs. Phosphorylation status of initiation factors and components of signaling pathways may vary in <italic>in vitro</italic> systems and in intact cells. In cell free systems, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) and eIF2α kinases, and many other kinases become phosphorylated due to the presence of essential supplements, such as ATP and creatine phosphate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011607-Mikami1">[44]</xref>. Phosphorylation of eIF2α may introduce a new limiting step in the translation process at the level of initiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011607-Krishnamoorthy1">[45]</xref>. Thus, DCB-3503-induced decrease in the rate of polypeptide chain elongation may not be fully reflected in the rate of protein synthesis <italic>in vitro</italic>, in contrast to the situation <italic>in vivo</italic>. miRNAs are small noncoding RNAs that regulate the stability and/or translation of mRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011607-Ruvkun1">[46]</xref>. Preliminary studies of miRNA profiling showed that DCB-3503 altered the homeostasis of a number of miRNAs after 4-hour treatment (unpublished data). The possibility that the regulated miRNA homeostasis is a cause or consequence of inhibition of protein synthesis is currently under investigation.</p>
<p>In summary, our results indicate that DCB-3503 inhibits protein synthesis by reducing the rate of polypeptide chain elongation. The global inhibition effect on protein synthesis, however, could be expected to suppress proteins with a shorter half-life more profoundly than proteins with a longer half-life. The immediate and rapid changes of these proteins regulated by translation are important in physiological conditions like apoptosis and cellular stress. Such proteins could include cyclin D1 or co-activators regulating NF-κB mediated transcription. The half-lives and the roles of these proteins down-regulated by DCB-3503 in different cells or tissues could be different. Long-term suppression of protein synthesis could lose the selectivity. This can explain why DCB-3503 has therapeutic activity against cancer cell growth, lupus, and arthritis in mice when it is given every three days, as we reported previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011607-Gao1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011607-Shiah1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011607-Choi1">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011607-You1">[48]</xref>. Therapeutic index of DCB-3503 against cancer cells <italic>in vivo</italic> may be lost when it is given daily. The effectiveness of this class of analogs for the treatment of disease will be highly schedule-dependent. The mechanism of inhibition of protein synthesis by DCB-3503 is likely to be distinct from the known inhibitors of protein synthesis. Unraveling this mechanism may open a window for new therapeutic opportunities for the treatment of human cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma. DCB-3503 may be used in combination treatment of malignant cancers with therapeutic agents that show different mechanisms of action. It can also be used in the treatment of resistance phenotypes characterized by MDR-1 and MRP-1 overexpression.</p>

<p>DCB-3503 inhibited [14C]-thymidine incorporation in a time- and dose-dependent manner, but not [14C]-uridine incorporation in PANC-1 cells. The inhibitory effect of DCB-3503 on [14C]-thymidine incorporation was time-dependent (A) and dose-dependent (B) in PANC-1 cells. DCB-3503 showed less than 50% inhibition on [14C]-uridine incorporation in either PANC-1 cells followed by different time (C) or dose treatment (D). E.
