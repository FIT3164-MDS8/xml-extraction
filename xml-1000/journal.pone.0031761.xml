        <p>Irradiation and DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic agents are commonly used in anticancer treatments. Following DNA damage FOXM1 protein levels are often elevated. In this study, we sought to investigate the potential role of FOXM1 in programmed cell death induced by DNA-damage. Human cancer cells after FOXM1 suppression were subjected to doxorubicin or γ-irradiation treatment. Our findings indicate that FOXM1 downregulation by stable or transient knockdown using RNAi or by treatment with proteasome inhibitors that target FOXM1 strongly sensitized human cancer cells of different origin to DNA-damage-induced apoptosis. We showed that FOXM1 suppresses the activation of pro-apoptotic JNK and positively regulates anti-apoptotic Bcl-2, suggesting that JNK activation and Bcl-2 down-regulation could mediate sensitivity to DNA-damaging agent-induced apoptosis after targeting FOXM1. Since FOXM1 is widely expressed in human cancers, our data further support the fact that it is a valid target for combinatorial anticancer therapy.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>γ-irradiation and DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic drugs play a key role in anticancer therapy due to their ability to induce DNA double-strand breaks leading to cancer cell death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031761-BurdakRothkamm1">[1]</xref>. Since cancer cells often become resistant to DNA-damaging agents, it is important to determine the mechanisms of drug-resistance. Several studies have reported that in response to IR, etoposide, daunorubicin or doxorubicin treatment FOXM1 protein level increases in a dose-dependent manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031761-Tan1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031761-Pandit1">[4]</xref>. FOXM1 is considered to be a master regulator of the cell cycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031761-Korver1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031761-Ye1">[6]</xref> by controlling the expression of genes that are crucial for G1/S and G2/M progression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031761-Wang1">[7]</xref>. FOXM1 is abundantly expressed in a wide range of human cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031761-Pilarsky1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031761-Kwok1">[11]</xref>, suggesting that targeting FOXM1 could be a therapeutic strategy against human malignancies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031761-Gartel1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031761-Radhakrishnan1">[13]</xref>. FOXM1 has been implicated in the DNA-damage response pathway, for example DNA repair genes, XRCC1 and BRCA2 were identified as direct transcriptional targets of FOXM1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031761-Tan1">[2]</xref>. In addition, the role of FOXM1 in response to DNA-damage has been investigated in the context of human cancer cells with wild type p53 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031761-Tan1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031761-Kwok1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031761-Chetty1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031761-AlvarezFernandez1">[15]</xref>. However, tumor suppressor p53 was found to be a negative regulator of FOXM1 and DNA-damage strongly upregulated the level of FOXM1 in the absence of p53 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031761-Barsotti1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031761-Pandit1">[4]</xref>. Consequently, we hypothesized that DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic agents may not be as efficient in the absence of p53, as they stabilize FOXM1 protein level leading to protection against DNA-damage-induced apoptosis. Since FOXM1 is potentially an oncogenic transcription factor and it is also involved in invasion and angiogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031761-Dai1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031761-Li1">[24]</xref>, treatment of tumors where p53 is mutated or inactivated with DNA-damaging agents could be detrimental for patients. Our group reported previously that suppression of FOXM1 by thiazole antibiotics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031761-Radhakrishnan2">[25]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031761-Halasi1">[28]</xref> and by proteasome inhibitors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031761-Bhat3">[29]</xref> correlates with the degree of apoptosis suggesting that FOXM1 may act as a potential inhibitor of apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031761-Radhakrishnan2">[25]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031761-Bhat2">[27]</xref>. Moreover, it has been shown recently that breast cancer cells with elevated levels of FOXM1 became insensitive to Herceptin, paclitaxel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031761-Carr1">[30]</xref> and cisplatin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031761-Kwok1">[11]</xref>. Therefore, it is evident that FOXM1 might inhibit apoptosis induced by various anticancer drugs.</p>
      <p>c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs; also known as stress-activated protein kinases, SAPKs) respond to diverse extracellular stimuli and environmental stresses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031761-Ip1">[31]</xref>. The JNK signaling pathway regulates many cellular processes, such as proliferation, survival, apoptosis and differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031761-Davis1">[32]</xref>. FOXM1 has been shown to transcriptionally activate JNK1 to control cell cycle progression and invasion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031761-Wang3">[18]</xref>. However, the outcome of JNK activation is determined by the duration of JNK signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031761-Chen2">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031761-Ventura1">[34]</xref>. Short-term JNK activation is linked to proliferation, while sustained activation of JNK usually leads to apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031761-Chen2">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031761-Ventura1">[34]</xref>. B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) is an antiapoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031761-Cory1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031761-Zhou1">[36]</xref>. Bcl-2 has a central role in the intrinsic apoptotic pathway acting as the guardian of the mitochondria by inhibiting Bax activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031761-Cory1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031761-Llambi1">[37]</xref>. Forced overexpression of Bcl-2 in several cultured cell lines conferred resistance to chemotherapeutic agents and irradiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031761-Cory1">[35]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In this study, we examined whether FOXM1 plays a role in cell death induced by DNA-damage in human tumor cell lines with mutant p53. We demonstrate that stable or transient knockdown of FOXM1 using RNAi increases the sensitivity of different human cancer cells to DNA-damaging agents including doxorubicin treatment and γ-irradiation. Moreover, we show that combination of proteasome inhibitors that inhibit FOXM1 with DNA-damaging agents induces very robust apoptosis. Our findings suggest that JNK activation and Bcl-2 downregulation may account for the increased cell death after suppression of FOXM1 in combination with DNA-damage.</p>

        <title>Knockdown of FOXM1 sensitizes human cancer cells to DNA-damaging agents</title>
        <p>First, isogenic HCT 116 p53 proficient and deficient human colon cancer cells with FOXM1 knockdown were treated with different concentrations of doxorubicin (Doxo) and cell death was assessed by immunoblotting for markers of apoptosis including cleaved caspase-3 and PARP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031761-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). Knockdown of FOXM1 enhanced sensitivity of colon cancer cells to doxorubicin-mediated apoptosis independently of p53 status. p53 proficient cells with FOXM1 knockdown underwent stronger apoptosis compared to their p53 deficient counterparts. This observation could be explained by the presence of p53-dependent apoptotic signaling in the p53-proficient cells, but not in the p53-deficient cells following DNA-damage.</p>
        <p>About 50% of human tumors harbor mutant or inactivated p53; consequently the p53-dependent apoptotic pathway cannot be exploited for the eradication of cancer cells following anticancer treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031761-Levine1">[39]</xref>. To investigate the possible role of FOXM1 in DNA-damage-induced apoptosis in cell lines with mutant p53, which are usually more resistant to chemotherapy than cancer cell lines with wild-type p53, MIA PaCa-2 vector control and FOXM1 knockdown human pancreatic cancer cell lines harboring mutant p53 were treated with increasing concentrations of doxorubicin and immunoblotting was performed for FOXM1, cleaved caspase-3 and PARP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031761-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). In accordance with earlier studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031761-Tan1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031761-Pandit1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031761-Kwok1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031761-Chetty1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031761-Teh1">[40]</xref>, we also observed that following DNA-damage FOXM1 protein level is elevated. But more importantly, we found that the absence of FOXM1 sensitized cancer cells to cell death induced by doxorubicin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031761-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>) as detected by the cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP. To verify that this phenomenon is not cell line specific, MDA-MB-231 human breast (p53-mutant) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031761-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>) and Hep3B human liver (p53-null) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031761-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>) vector control and FOXM1 knockdown cancer cells were treated with different concentrations of doxorubicin. Western blot analysis of cleaved caspase-3 demonstrated that knockdown of FOXM1 also sensitized breast and liver cancer cells to doxorubicin-induced apoptosis.</p>
        <p>Additionally, we tested whether transient knockdown of FOXM1 results in increased apoptosis following DNA-damage. To attain sufficient transient knockdown of FOXM1 we utilized small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) against FOXM1. MIA PaCa-2 pancreatic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031761-g001">Fig. 1E</xref>) and MDA-MB-231 breast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031761-g001">Fig. 1F</xref>) control and FOXM1 knockdown cancer cells were treated with various concentrations of doxorubicin. We found that cells with transient FOXM1 knockdown were more susceptible to apoptosis after DNA-damage as detected by immunoblotting for cleaved caspase-3, further supporting the idea that FOXM1 might play a role in DNA-damage-induced apoptosis.</p>
        <p>In order to confirm this effect, MIA PaCa-2 and MDA-MB-231 vector control and FOXM1 knockdown cells were subjected to ionizing radiation. γ-irradiation also induced robust apoptosis as detected by the cleavage of caspase-3 in FOXM1 knockdown cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031761-g002">Fig. 2A, B</xref>). In addition, to quantitatively assess the degree of cell death induced by γ-irradiation MIA PaCa-2 and MDA-MB-231 vector control and FOXM1 knockdown cells were γ-irradiated with different doses, harvested and stained with propidium iodide. The extent of apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031761-g002">Fig. 2C, D</xref>). Both pancreatic and breast FOXM1 knockdown cells exhibited significant increase in cell death following treatment compared to the irradiated control counterparts. Altogether, these data suggest that suppressing FOXM1 in human cancer cells could make them more susceptible to cell death induced by DNA-damaging agents.</p>

        <title>Treatment with proteasome inhibitors sensitizes human cancer cells to apoptosis induced by DNA-damage</title>
        <p>Our group has reported previously that thiazole antibiotics thiostrepton and Siomycin A are potent inhibitors of FOXM1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031761-Radhakrishnan2">[25]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031761-Halasi1">[28]</xref> and act as proteasome inhibitors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031761-Bhat3">[29]</xref>.

To test FOXM1/proteasome inhibitors together with DNA-damaging agents, MIA PaCa-2 pancreatic cancer cell line was treated with the combination of doxorubicin and bortezomib (Bor) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031761-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>) or thiostrepton (Thio) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031761-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>), respectively.

Analysis of cleaved caspase-3 expression by western blot revealed that the combination of DNA-damaging agents with FOXM1/proteasome inhibitors led to increased apoptosis in breast and liver cancer cells compared to treatment with drugs alone. Since treatment with DNA-damaging agents in conjunction with FOXM1/proteasome inhibitors induced such marked apoptosis, the effect of their combination was also examined on long-term survival by performing clonogenic assay. MIA PaCa-2 and MDA-MB-231 human cancer cells were treated with γ-irradiation along with thiostrepton or bortezomib and the colony forming ability was assessed 10 days later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031761-g003">Fig. 3G, H</xref>). We found that the combination of γ-irradiation and FOXM1/proteasome inhibitors significantly inhibited colony formation giving rise to much less number of colonies compared to individual drug treatment. Taken together, these data suggest that the combination of commonly used DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic agents and FOXM1/proteasome inhibitors could be considered as a treatment strategy in order to improve therapeutic response in various cancer treatments.</p>

        <title>Sensitivity to DNA-damage after suppression of FOXM1 is partially attributed to JNK activation and Bcl-2 downregulation</title>
        <p>It is an intriguing fact that FOXM1, a known regulator of the cell cycle, may inhibit DNA-damage-induced apoptosis. In order to elucidate the possible underlying mechanism we turned to the JNK signaling pathway, because it has been implicated in responding to diverse stimuli including various apoptotic stimuli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031761-Davis1">[32]</xref>. It has been reported that γ-irradiation leads to JNK activation, which mediates radiation-induced apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031761-Chen2">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031761-Su1">[42]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031761-Kim2">[44]</xref>. To determine the effect of DNA-damage on the activation of JNK in the presence or absence of FOXM1, MIA PaCa-2 vector control and FOXM1 knockdown pancreatic cancer cells were γ-irradiated and immunoblotted for phospho-SAPK/JNK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031761-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). We observed that in FOXM1-knockdown cells the induction of cell death following γ-irradiation was accompanied by elevated phosphorylation of JNK, suggesting that FOXM1 may inhibit the activation of JNK in the presence of DNA-damage. In order to investigate the potential role of JNK activation in apoptosis induced by DNA-damage in FOXM1 knockdown cells, MIA PaCa-2 pancreatic and MDA-MB-231 breast FOXM1 knockdown cancer cells were γ-irradiated in the presence of the specific JNK inhibitor, SP600125 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031761-g004">Fig. 4B–E</xref>). Western blot analysis for cleaved caspase-3 showed that induction of apoptosis by irradiation was attenuated by treatment with the JNK inhibitor, suggesting that JNK activation is partially responsible for the programmed cell death following DNA-damage.</p>

        <p>We also looked for additional mechanisms that might be involved in the sensitization to DNA-damage in the absence of FOXM1. The Bcl-2 family of proteins is one of the major regulators of apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031761-Cory1">[35]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031761-Llambi1">[37]</xref>. Bcl-2 is best known to prevent apoptosis by governing mitochondrial membrane integrity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031761-Cory1">[35]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031761-Llambi1">[37]</xref>. Bcl-2 was also found to confer resistance to chemotherapeutic agents and irradiation in various cell lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031761-Cory1">[35]</xref>. Immunoblot analysis of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL expression after γ-irradiation revealed that Bcl-2 was downregulated in FOXM1 knockdown pancreatic and breast cancer cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031761-g004">Fig. 4F, G</xref>), while Bcl-xL protein level remained unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031761-g004">Fig. 4F</xref>). To examine whether Bcl-2 is a transcriptional target of FOXM1, Bcl-2 mRNA expression was assessed by quantitative real-time (qRT)-PCR in vector control and FOXM1 knockdown pancreatic and breast cancer cells. FOXM1 knockdown led to 30–40% reduction in Bcl-2 mRNA expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031761-g004">Fig. 4H, I</xref>), suggesting that FOXM1 transcriptionally up-regulates Bcl-2. Future experiments are needed to determine whether Bcl-2 is a direct target of FOXM1. These data suggest that suppression of FOXM1 might also sensitize human cancer cells to DNA-damage via Bcl-2 downregulation.</p>
        <p>In summary, we demonstrated that FOXM1 suppression by stable or transient knockdown using RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031761-g001">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031761-g002">2</xref>) or by treatment with FOXM1/proteasome inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031761-g003">Fig. 3</xref>) sensitizes human cancer cells of different origin to apoptosis induced by DNA-damaging agents including doxorubicin and γ-irradiation. The effect of endogenous FOXM1 knockdown in human cancer cells on apoptosis after doxorubicin and γ-irradiation treatment has never been investigated before. JNK activation and Bcl-2 downregulation as a result of FOXM1 knockdown may explain the resistance of FOXM1 proficient cells to apoptosis following DNA-damage. Overall, our findings in accordance with previous reports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031761-Kwok1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031761-Chetty1">[14]</xref> confirm that targeting FOXM1 in combination with DNA-damaging drugs or with γ-irradiation could be a valuable therapeutic approach against different types of human cancer. Since some of the FOXM1/proteasome inhibitors such as bortezomib are already in clinical practice, the data presented here also suggest that the administration of commonly used DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic agents in conjunction with FOXM1/proteasome inhibitors or with other potential FOXM1 inhibitors should be warranted serious consideration in order to improve therapeutic outcome.</p>
