<abstract>
<p>C-C chemokine receptor 2 (Ccr2) is a key pro-inflammatory marker of classic (M1) macrophage activation. Although Ccr2 is known to be expressed both constitutively and inductively, the full regulatory mechanism of its expression remains unclear. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is not only a master regulator of energy homeostasis but also a central regulator of inflammation. In this study, we sought to assess AMPK’s role in regulating RAW264.7 macrophage Ccr2 protein levels in resting (M0) or LPS-induced M1 states. In both M0 and M1 RAW264.7 macrophages, knockdown of the AMPKα1 subunit by siRNA led to increased Ccr2 levels whereas pharmacologic (A769662) activation of AMPK, attenuated LPS-induced increases in Ccr2 expression in an AMPK dependent fashion. The increases in Ccr2 levels by AMPK downregulation were partially reversed by NF-κB inhibition whereas TNF-a inhibition had minimal effects. Our results indicate that AMPK is a negative regulator of Ccr2 expression in RAW264.7 macrophages, and that the mechanism of action of AMPK inhibition of Ccr2 is mediated, in part, through the NF-κB pathway.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Macrophages play a key role in the innate immune response and help to direct the acquired immune response. The acute phase of inflammation is associated with pro-inflammatory classical (M1) macrophage activation. The resolution phase of inflammation is associated with alternatively activated (M2) macrophages, which exhibit an anti-inflammatory phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0147279.ref001">1</xref>]. M1 macrophages are activated by treatment with IFNγ or LPS, and M2 macrophages are activated by treatment with Th2 cytokines IL-4 or IL-13. Switch to the M2 phenotype can be enhanced by IL-10. Macrophages can also be skewed during differentiation in vitro, and the resultant phenotype depends upon the cytokine provided to support their differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0147279.ref002">2</xref>]. Recently, different regulatory pathways have been shown to be associated with either the M1 or M2 activation states. They involve a variety of molecular machineries at the genomic, transcriptomic, and post-transcriptomic levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0147279.ref003">3</xref>].</p>
<p>C-C chemokine receptor 2 (Ccr2) is the primary receptor for monocyte chemoattractant protein 1/chemokine ligand 2 (MCP1/CCL2), a member of chemokine family of proteins. Ccr2 is expressed on monocytes and macrophages, where it serves as a crucial recruitment factor by directing cells to sites of injury and inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0147279.ref004">4</xref>]. Ccr2 is one of the M1 macrophage phenotype markers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0147279.ref005">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0147279.ref008">8</xref>] and has been shown to be involved in macrophage-dependent inflammatory responses in various chronic inflammatory diseases, including atherosclerosis, Alzheimer disease, uveitis, and choroidal neovascularization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0147279.ref009">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0147279.ref012">12</xref>] Ccr2 is expressed at the cell surface both variably and under stringent regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0147279.ref013">13</xref>]; however, the underlying mechanisms are obscure.</p>
<p>AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a serine/threonine kinase that regulates energy homeostasis and metabolic stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0147279.ref014">14</xref>]. AMPK acts as a sensor of cellular energy status and maintains the balance between ATP production and consumption. In mammals, AMPK exists as a heterotrimer with α, β, and γ subunits, each of which is encoded by two or three genes (α1, α2, β1, β2, γ1, γ2, and γ3). The α subunit possesses catalytic activity, whereas the β and γ subunits are regulatory and maintain the stability of the heterotrimer complex. Phosphorylation of α subunit at Thr<sup>172</sup> is essential for AMPK activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0147279.ref015">15</xref>]. In macrophages, AMPKα1 is the predominant isoform expressed, whereas AMPKα2 expression is negligible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0147279.ref016">16</xref>].</p>
<p>Previous work by others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0147279.ref017">17</xref>] and our group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0147279.ref018">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0147279.ref022">22</xref>] suggests that AMPK has a much wider range of functions. Over the past several years, a role of AMPK in the regulation of inflammatory response has been revealed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0147279.ref023">23</xref>]. Because AMPK’s functions are closely linked to macrophage polarization skewing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0147279.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0147279.ref024">24</xref>], we hypothesized that AMPK regulates Ccr2 expression in macrophages. To address this in the present study, we utilized the macrophage cell line RAW264.7 and investigated the role of AMPKα1 in regulating Ccr2 expression in the LPS-treated (M1) or untreated (M0) state.</p>

<title>AMPKα1 regulates Ccr2 expression in RAW264.7 macrophages</title>
<p>To study the function of AMPK in regulating macrophage Ccr2 expression, we used the macrophage cell line RAW264.7 and downregulated the catalytically active AMPKα1 subunit with siRNA. Knockdown of AMPKα1 suppressed AMPKα1 protein levels by approximately 90% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0147279.g001">Fig 1A</xref>) without detectable compensation by AMPKα2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0147279.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Knockdown of AMPKα1 was associated with decreased total and total phospho-AMPKα (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0147279.s001">S1 Fig</xref>), indicating that AMPKα1 is the predominant α isoform in RAW264.7 macrophages. LPS induction of the M1 state increases Ccr2 expression in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0147279.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). Knockdown of AMPK using siRNA was associated with increased LPS-induced Ccr2 expression in both LPS-treated (M1) and untreated (M0) RAW264.7 macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0147279.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). These results indicate that AMPKα1 is inhibitory for Ccr2 expression.</p>

<title>Pharmacological activation of AMPK inhibits Ccr2 expression in RAW264.7 macrophages in the M1 state</title>
<p>Although 5-amino-4-imidazole carboxamide riboside (AICAR) is used extensively as an AMPK activator, the effects of AICAR have been shown to be mostly independent of AMPK in macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0147279.ref025">25</xref>]. Therefore, we tested the more specific AMPK activator, A769662 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0147279.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0147279.ref027">27</xref>]. A769662 treatments led to increased phosphorylation of AMPKα in a dose-dependent manner in control siRNA-treated RAW264.7 macrophages. In contrast, AMPKα phosphorylation was attenuated in RAW264.7 macrophages treated with AMPKα1 siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0147279.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Application of A769662 inhibited Ccr2 expression in a dose-dependent manner in the LPS-induced M1 state of RAW264.7, further indicating that activation of AMPKα1 inhibits RAW264.7 Ccr2 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0147279.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). This inhibitory effect of A769662 was lost if cells were pretreated with AMPKα1 siRNA but not with control scrambled siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0147279.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). These results suggest that A769662 inhibits Ccr2 expression in an AMPK-dependent manner in the M1 state of RAW264.7 macrophages.</p>

<title>Loss of AMPKα1 leads to increased expression of Ccr2 in RAW264.7 macrophages through the NF-κB pathway in the M0 state</title>
<p>Previous studies have suggested that the NF-κB pathway is negatively regulated by AMPK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0147279.ref023">23</xref>]. To investigate whether the NF-κB pathway is involved in the AMPK-dependent downregulation of Ccr2 expression, we used Western blotting to examine the effects of AMPKα1 reduction on the NF-κB pathway. IκBα was degraded and the phosphorylation of NF-κB p65 was increased in RAW264.7 macrophages treated with AMPKα1 siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0147279.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). Nuclear extracts from RAW264.7 macrophages treated with AMPKα1 siRNA (but not control siRNA) showed an increase in the nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0147279.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). We next investigated the expression of A20 (or cylindromatosis), a deubiquinase with NF-κB-dependent transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0147279.ref028">28</xref>]. The expression of A20 was markedly higher in RAW264.7 macrophages treated with AMPKα1 siRNA compared to control-treated RAW264.7 macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0147279.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). These results suggest that AMPKα1 reduction causes activation of the NF-κB pathway.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the present study, we have shown that AMPKα1 regulates Ccr2 expression in RAW264.7 macrophages in both the M0 and the M1 states. Furthermore, we showed that AMPKα1 downregulation amplifies Ccr2 expression in RAW264.7 macrophages through the NF-κB signaling pathway. In our study, Ccr2 expression is increased in LPS-stimulated M1 RAW264.7 macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0147279.g001">Fig 1C</xref>) similarly to LPS-stimulated neutrophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0147279.ref035">35</xref>], but in contrast to other studies suggesting downregulation of Ccr2 expression in monocyte/macrophages by LPS via mechanisms involving receptor internalization and degradation as well as a reduction in <italic>Ccr2</italic> mRNA stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0147279.ref036">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0147279.ref040">40</xref>]. We speculate that these differences might be due to the different time points (up to 4 h in the previous studies vs. 12 h in our present study) and/or cell type [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0147279.ref030">30</xref>].</p>
<p>Our results indicate for the first time that AMPKα1 is a novel negative regulator of Ccr2 expression via NF-κB pathway in RAW264.7 macrophages. We demonstrated that the pharmacological AMPK activator, A769662, suppresses Ccr2 expression in RAW264.7 macrophages in an AMPK-dependent fashion, and that AMPKα1 reduction by siRNA leads increased Ccr2 expression in RAW264.7 macrophages in the M0 and LPS-stimulated M1 states (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0147279.g001">1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0147279.g002">2C</xref>). Sag <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0147279.ref016">16</xref>] reported that dominant-negative inactivation of AMPKα1 induces TNF-α and IL-6 in the LPS-stimulated M1 state, whereas constitutive activation of AMPKα1 inhibits production of these proinflammatory cytokines in M1 macrophages; this was the first implication of AMPKα1 as a potent regulator of functional macrophage polarization. Similarly, Yang <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0147279.ref041">41</xref>] reported that inactivation of AMPKα1 by short hairpin RNA or dominant-negative AMPKα1 increases TNF-α mRNA in the M0 and the LPS-stimulated M1 state, suggesting that AMPKα1 is a key determinant of basal inflammatory signaling and an important suppressor of LPS-induced inflammation in macrophages. We demonstrated that using anti-TNF-α neutralizing antibody, TNF-α is minimally involved in Ccr2 upregulation in RAW264.7 macrophages by AMPKα1 down-regulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0147279.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). Mounier <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0147279.ref024">24</xref>] reported that genetic deletion of AMPKα1 attenuates expression of CD206, a phenotypic M2 marker, in the IL-4 stimulated M2 state, suggesting AMPKα1 is required for acquisition of an M2 phenotype in macrophages. Thus, although additional studies are needed, our work (together with these prior studies) implicates AMPKα1 as an important regulator of functional and phenotypic polarization of macrophages.</p>
<p>Our data are consistent with the notion that Ccr2 is associated with M1 macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0147279.ref042">42</xref>] and that NF-κB is important for the expression of M1-specific cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0147279.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0147279.ref043">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0147279.ref044">44</xref>]. In our study, we showed that AMPKα1 suppresses Ccr2 expression in RAW264.7 macrophages by inhibiting the NF-κB pathway in the M0 and M1 state. Furthermore, the NF-κB inhibitor SM7368 reversed the effects of AMPKα1 knockdown on Ccr2 (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0147279.g003">3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0147279.g004">4C</xref>). This study provides new evidence that AMPKα1 plays a role in modulating Ccr2 expression in RAW264.7 macrophages, at least partly, through the NF-κB pathway. This AMPKα1 reduction (and resultant NF-κB activation) in RAW264.7 M0 macrophages is in line with our earlier work, in which we showed that deletion of AMPKα results in constitutive NF-κB activation in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0147279.ref022">22</xref>]. In the current investigation, we found that AMPKα1 reduction in RAW 264.7 macrophages increases the degradation of IκBα, leading to increased phosphorylation of NF-κB p65, its nuclear translocation, and the expression of A20 (an NF-κB-induced negative feedback regulator) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0147279.ref028">28</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0147279.g003">Fig 3A, 3B and 3C</xref>). Thus, our current work (together with our earlier work) suggests that AMPKα plays a key role in restricting NF-κB to a cytoplasmic location in resting M0 macrophages.</p>
<p>Many studies have suggested that the activation of AMPK inhibits the NF-κB signaling pathway through multiple mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0147279.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0147279.ref041">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0147279.ref045">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0147279.ref048">48</xref>], although in most cases these were not in cells of the immune system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0147279.ref023">23</xref>]. AMPKα1 has been shown to suppress NF-κB signaling indirectly via its downstream mediator SIRT1 in macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0147279.ref041">41</xref>]. Although the mechanism by which AMPKα1 regulates NF-κB is not fully elucidated, there is a possibility that AMPK inhibits IKK-dependent IκBα phosphorylation either directly or indirectly. Phosphorylation of IκBα by the upstream kinase IKK is essential for NF-κB nuclear translocation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0147279.ref049">49</xref>]. Our results demonstrated that AMPKα1 reduction leads to the degradation of IκBα and nuclear translocation of NF-κB, indicating that AMPKα1 either directly targets IKK activity, or targets another factor upstream of IKK. Previous studies have demonstrated a role of AMPK as an inhibitor of IKKβ activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0147279.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0147279.ref048">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0147279.ref050">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0147279.ref052">52</xref>]. Further study is required to determine the target of AMPKα1 for interference with the NF-κB pathway.</p>
<p>A769662 is a small-molecule, direct AMPK activator that does not increase cellular AMP or ADP, but acts instead by directly binding AMPK at activation site(s) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0147279.ref053">53</xref>]. Recently, salicylates (which are among the oldest medical compounds known to humankind) have been found to activate AMPK by direct binding to the same site as A769662 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0147279.ref054">54</xref>]. Some direct AMPK activators have been slated for human clinical trials for type 2 diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0147279.ref055">55</xref>], and it remains unclear whether the beneficial effects of long-term salicylate treatment on insulin resistance are mediated by inhibiting of NF-κB signaling, by AMPK activation, or by a combination of these pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0147279.ref056">56</xref>]. Galic <italic>et al</italic>. showed a causal role for macrophage AMPK in the development of insulin resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0147279.ref057">57</xref>], and Weisberg <italic>et al</italic>. showed the importance of Ccr2 in the development of insulin resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0147279.ref004">4</xref>]. We showed that A769662 attenuates LPS-induced Ccr2 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0147279.g002">Fig 2B</xref>), which is likely mediated via the NF-κB pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0147279.g004">Fig 4A and 4B</xref>) in an AMPK-dependent manner in RAW264.7 macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0147279.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). Although additional studies are needed, our findings (together with the previous works of Galic <italic>et al</italic>. and Weisberg <italic>et al</italic>.) raise a possibility that the beneficial effects of direct AMPK activators or salicylate-based drugs on inflammation and insulin resistance may be mediated, at least in part, by modulating macrophage CCR2 expression via NF-κB signaling.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we identified AMPKα1 as a novel negative regulator of Ccr2 expression in RAW264.7 macrophages at least in part through the NF-κB pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0147279.g005">Fig 5</xref>). Because Ccr2 and AMPK each plays an important role in numerous inflammatory diseases, our findings might provide fundamental insights not only into the regulatory mechanism of Ccr2 expression and the function of AMPK, but also into the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases.</p>
