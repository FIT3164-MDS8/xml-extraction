<abstract>
<p>In this paper, we evaluated the anti-<italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> activity and the possible inhibitory effect on its associated urease by Palmatine (Pal) from <italic>Coptis chinensis</italic>, and explored the potential underlying mechanism. Results indicated that Pal exerted inhibitory effect on four tested <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> strains (ATCC 43504, NCTC 26695, SS1 and ICDC 111001) by the agar dilution test with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values ranging from 100 to 200 Œºg/mL under neutral environment (pH 7.4), and from 75 to 100 Œºg/mL under acidic conditions (pH 5.3), respectively. Pal was observed to significantly inhibit both <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> urease (HPU) and jack bean urease (JBU) in a dose-dependent manner, with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 0.53 ¬± 0.01 mM and 0.03 ¬± 0.00 mM, respectively, as compared with acetohydroxamic acid, a well-known urease inhibitor (0.07 ¬± 0.01 mM for HPU and 0.02 ¬± 0.00 mM for JBU, respectively). Kinetic analyses showed that the type of urease inhibition by Pal was noncompetitive for both HPU and JBU. Higher effectiveness of thiol protectors against urease inhibition than the competitive Ni<sup>2+</sup> binding inhibitors was observed, indicating the essential role of the active-site sulfhydryl group in the urease inhibition by Pal. DTT reactivation assay indicated that the inhibition on the two ureases was reversible, further supporting that sulfhydryl group should be obligatory for urease inhibition by Pal. Furthermore, molecular docking study indicated that Pal interacted with the important sulfhydryl groups and inhibited the active enzymatic conformation through N-H <bold>‚àô</bold> œÄ interaction, but did not interact with the active site Ni<sup>2+</sup>. Taken together, Pal was an effective inhibitor of <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> and its urease targeting the sulfhydryl groups, representing a promising candidate as novel urease inhibitor. This investigation also gave additional scientific support to the use of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>chinensis</italic> to treat <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic>-related gastrointestinal diseases in traditional Chinese medicine. Pal might be a potentially beneficial therapy for gastritis and peptic ulcers induced by <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> infection and other urease-related diseases.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> is a Gram-negative spiral bacterium that colonizes the stomachs. <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> has been classified as the major risk factor of gastrointestinal diseases, including gastritis, gastric and duodenal ulceration and gastric carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168944.ref001">1</xref>]. In the past decades, several treatment regimens were available to cure <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> infection. Among them, the most frequently used eradication regimen was the triple therapy consisting of amoxicillin, clarithromycin and proton-pump inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168944.ref002">2</xref>]. Although this therapy has a success rate of 80%, the undesirable side effects, poor compliance, and antibiotic resistance cannot be ignored, which compromise its clinical application to some extent. Hence, there are continual efforts to discover potentially effective alternative options.</p>
<p>Urease (urea amidohydrolases, EC 3.5, 1.5) is known to be an important biological feature and major contributor to the pathologies induced by <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic>. Urease initiates the hydrolysis of urea generating ammonia to neutralize stomach acid in order to create a suitable pH environment that the bacterium requires to survive and colonize [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168944.ref003">3</xref>]. In the structural unit of urease, nickel ions (Ni<sup>2+</sup>) and the sulfhydryl groups, at the active site of the enzyme, are essential for the catalytic effect of urease. The activity of urease has also been regarded as the influential factor of the nitrogen utilization in organisms. The urease causes the urea decomposition and re-absorption, which leads to abnormal environmental pH elevation and induces a variety of diseases in the human body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168944.ref004">4</xref>]. Hence, urease is considered as a critical target in the research and exploitation of antibacterial agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168944.ref005">5</xref>]. Bioactive components of natural origin have been under enormous investigations as potential effective urease inhibitors for the treatment of <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> infection.</p>
<p><italic>Coptis chinensis</italic>, known as ‚Äòhuanglian‚Äô in Chinese, is traditionally used in China for the treatment of diarrhea and <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic>-related gastrointestinal diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168944.ref006">6</xref>]. Our earlier work has shown that the water extract of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>chinensis</italic> could inhibit HPU at a comparatively low concentration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168944.ref007">7</xref>]. And the anti-urease effect of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>chinensis</italic> was more pronounced than its major active constituent berberine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168944.ref008">8</xref>], implying that ingredients other than berberine might also play an important role in its urease inhibition. Palmatine (C<sub>21</sub>H<sub>25</sub>NO<sub>4</sub>, Pal), an active naturally occurring isoquinoline alkaloids, is another important bioactive component derived from <italic>C</italic>. <italic>chinensis</italic> besides berberine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168944.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168944.ref010">10</xref>]. Modern pharmacological investigations show that Pal exerts a broad variety of potentially useful pharmacological and therapeutic properties ranging from antibacterial to anticancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168944.ref011">11</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168944.ref018">18</xref>]. In China, Pal has been developed into an anti-inflammatory agent included in <italic>Chinese Pharmacopoeia</italic> (2015 Edition), and is widely used in clinical practice for the treatment of inflammatory diseases, including gynecological inflammation and digestive disorders like bacillary dysentery and enteritis, etc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168944.ref019">19</xref>]. Previous report indicates that Pal and <italic>C</italic>. <italic>chinensis</italic> exhibited anti-<italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> activity as well as inhibition on <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic>-induced gastric inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168944.ref020">20</xref>]. However, little work has been done to illuminate the mechanism underlying their anti-<italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> activity. Taking into account the crucial role that urease plays in the survival and gastric colonization of <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic>, in this follow-up study, we endeavored to further investigate the possible inhibition of Pal on <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> and its associated urease, and probe the potential underlying mechanism.</p>

<title>The growth condition of <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> strains and determination of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) by the agar dilution method</title>
<p>A total of four <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> strains were studied, including three reference strains ATCC 43504, NCTC 26695 and SS1 gifted from Professor Richard Ferrero, Monash University, Australia, and one clinical isolate ICDC 111001 obtained from Professor Zhang Jianzhong, Chinese Center of Disease Control and Prevention. All the strains were cultured on Columbia agar supplemented with bovine serum albumin for 72 h at 37¬∞C under 98% humidity and microaerophilic conditions (5% O<sub>2</sub>, 10% CO<sub>2</sub>, and 85% N<sub>2</sub>).</p>
<p>The MICs of Pal against the four <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> strains were evaluated by using agar dilution method. Series of concentrations of 25, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150 and 200 Œºg/mL Pal were used. <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> strains were harvested and resuspended in PBS (1.0‚Äì2.0 McFarland were defined based on the strain properties). And 0.1 mL <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> suspension was inoculated and flooded in the Pal-containing or H<sub>2</sub>O (control) agar plate. After 72 h, the MIC values were determined as the lowest concentration at which there was no strain growth judged by visual examination. Metronidazole was used as the positive control. The experiments were evaluated under two different pH (7.4 and 5.3) conditions and repeated twice.</p>

<p>HPU was prepared as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168944.ref021">21</xref>]. The standard urease assay mixture included 150 mM urea in 20 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.5). After addition of small aliquots of enzyme-containing solution of urease, the assay ran for 20 min. The enzymatic activity was evaluated spectrophotometrically by detecting the ammonia concentration at 595 nm according to the modified Berthelot (phenol-hypochlorite) method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168944.ref022">22</xref>]. Urease activity was estimated with JBU as a standard, the specific activity of HPU was determined to be 17.0 U/mg. One unit of urease activity was defined as 1 Œºmol of ammonia released per min at 25¬∞C. The amount of protein was determined by commercial Bradford Protein Assay Kit with BSA as a standard. The amount of ammonia released was decided from a standard curve. The activity of uninhibited urease was defined as the control activity of 100%.</p>
<p>Reaction mixtures comprising 0.25 mg/mL HPU or JBU and different concentrations of Pal or AHA at the volume ratio of 1:1, were incubated at 37¬∞C in 20 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.5) in the absence of urea. The reactions were initiated by mixing the urease and the inhibitor. The preincubation mixture was withdrawn at 20 min and immediately transferred into the standard assay mixtures for urease residual activity determination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168944.ref023">23</xref>]. Inhibition rate (%) was calculated following the formula: I % = (1-activity with inhibitors/activity without inhibitors) √ó 100%. The IC<sub>50</sub> was expressed as the concentration of inhibitor that decreased urease activity by 50% and calculated by plotting the percent of inhibition. The experiments were triply performed.</p>

<title>Molecular docking protocol</title>
<p>Docking studies were performed as our previous investigation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168944.ref024">24</xref>]. Pal was docked onto the ligand binding sites of the two ureases by Auto-Dock version 4.0, graphical user interface AutoDock Tools (ADT1.5.2) and the hybrid Lamarckian Genetic Algorithm (LGA). The three-dimensional (3D) crystallographic structures of HPU (PDB ID-1E9Y) complexed with JBU (PDB 3LA4) were downloaded from the RCSB Protein Data Bank. The 3D structure (PDB format) of Pal was modeled by using chem 3D Ultra 8.0 software. For docking, we analyzed the 3D results using the PyMOL molecular graphics system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168944.ref025">25</xref>]. The cubic grid box of 60 √Ö size (x, y, z) with a spacing of 0.5 √Ö and grid maps were created. The average coordinates of the two Ni<sup>2+</sup> were in the center of the grid. Other docking parameters were set to the software‚Äôs default values. The docked complexes were geometry optimized and the results of the most favorable free energy of binding were chosen as the resultant complex structures. The distance (√Ö) between hydrogen bond forming residues was measured.</p>

<title>Urease protection against Pal inactivation</title>
<p>In the current research, the role of thiol protectors (DTT, GSH, and L‚Äëcys) in urease inactivation by Pal was investigated by comparing the thiol-free system at four time points of incubation (5, 10, 20, and 40 min). According to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0168944.g004">Fig 4A and 4B</xref>, it was found that the inhibitory effects of Pal against HPU and JBU were time-dependent, and the thiol-containing compounds could significantly alleviate urease from loss of enzymatic activity by Pal, indicating Pal might interact with the sulfhydryl groups of urease. Moreover, the urease protection against inactivation by Pal was not obviously dependent on the incubation time.</p>

<p>To investigate whether the active site nickel ions was involved in the inactivation by Pal, two active-site competitive binding inhibitors (NaF and BA) were also employed in the urease protection experiment. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0168944.g004">Fig 4C and 4D</xref>, in the presence of BA or NaF, the activity of enzyme inactivated by Pal decreased from 98.6%, 54.6% to 22.42%, 20.35% and 86.6%, 42.9% to 33.08%, 19.91% toward HPU and JBU, respectively, even lower than that in the presence of Pal and NaF or BA alone. The data suggested that there was probably a synergic relationship between Pal and NaF or BA. Taken together, higher effectiveness of thiol protectors against Pal inhibition than the inorganic compounds suggested that the urease inhibition might be attributed to the interaction of Pal with the active-site sulfhydryl group.</p>

By adding DTT after 20 min co-incubation of Pal with JBU or HPU, the urease activity was observed to recover time-dependently. Compared with the urease activity of addition of 1.25 mM DTT without Pal (The HPU or JBU activity was ca. 100%), the HPU activity was partly restored to ca. 46% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0168944.g006">Fig 6A</xref>), and JBU restored to ca. 78% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0168944.g006">Fig 6B</xref>) of their initial activity. However, the HPU and JBU activities were restored compared with their initial activity (Before adding DTT after 20 min co-incubation of JBU or HPU with Pal), which did not cause any further inactivation after DTT addition. Restoration of the activity of Pal-modified urease with DTT was congruent with the result of urease protection experiment by thiol-containing compounds abovementioned, further supporting that the inactivation of urease might involve interaction of Pal to the sulfhydryl groups at the active site of ureases.</p>

<title>Molecular docking study</title>
<p>To give an explanation and understanding of the observed appreciable activity and mechanism revealed by the protective experiment, molecular docking of Pal into the binding site of of HPU and JBU was performed based on the HPU (1E9Y) and JBU (3LA4) complex structures, and the best possible binding modes of Pal were depicted as cartoon model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0168944.g007">Fig 7</xref>) and enzyme surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0168944.g008">Fig 8</xref>), respectively. From the docking conformation, it was observed that Pal was well filled in the active pocket of the two ureases, tightly anchoring the helix-turn-helix motif over the active-site cavity through O-H‚àô ‚àô ‚àôN hydrogen bonding interactions for both HPU and JBU, which prevented the flap of the urease active-site cavity from backing to the close position. For HPU, 2-OCH<sub>3</sub> of Pal as the hydrogen bond donor, was found between the OH and the backbone N atom of ARG-338 (H‚àô ‚àô ‚àôN distance = 3.1 √Ö), which was located on the mobile flap closing the active site of the enzyme. And for JBU, 2-OCH<sub>3</sub> and 3-OCH<sub>3</sub> of Pal formed two strong O-H‚àô ‚àô ‚àôN hydrogen bond (H‚àô ‚àô ‚àôN distance = 2.1 √Ö, H‚àô ‚àô ‚àôN distance = 2.9 √Ö) to the backbone N atom of ARG-639.

<p><italic>Coptis chinensis</italic> has been commonly employed in traditional oriental medicine for the treatment of various diseases, including <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic>-related gastrointestinal disorders.

Han et al. previously reported that Pal exhibited inhibitory effect against <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> (KCCM 41351) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168944.ref006">6</xref>].

In the present study, Pal was observed to exhibit suppressive effect towards four <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> strains including three reference strains (ATCC 43504, NCTC 26695, SS1) and one clinical isolate (ICDC 111001) under neutral and acidic conditions. And the anti-<italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> activity of Pal was superior under acidic environment as compared with that of the neutral condition. This finding suggested that Pal might exert inhibitory effect toward <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> in the stomach, which was in congruent with the the <italic>in vivo</italic> anti- <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> effect in the previous report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168944.ref020">20</xref>].</p>
<p>Urease has been implicated as an essential colonization and virulent factor of <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic>. Urease allows <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> to survive in the low pH environment of the stomach during colonization by the hydrolysis of urea into ammonia and carbon dioxide to neutralize the bacterial microenvironment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168944.ref026">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168944.ref027">27</xref>]. Therefore, substances that could decrease the urease activity of <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> would be a potential anti-<italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> agent. And exploration of safe and efficacious urease inhibitors derived from medicinal herbs is gaining increasing importance as an alternate therapy against <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> infections.</p>
<p>Urease of different origins such as plants and bacteria composes of inconsistent types of subunits, nevertheless, ureases share similar amino acid sequences and thus exhibit common catalytic characteristics. Urease from jack bean (<italic>Canavalia ensiformis</italic>, JBU), the first enzyme to be crystallized and the best-characterized urease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168944.ref028">28</xref>], is deemed as a model urease for the inhibitory mechanism research. In this study, JBU was employed for comparison and reference purpose. In order to probe the mechanism of inhibition of Pal on <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic>, Pal was evaluated for its anti-urease capacity. From the results obtained, it was found that Pal could effectively inhibit the activities of both HPU and JBU. This result indicated that the urease-inhibitory activity of Pal might be closely associated with the suppression of <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> growth.</p>
<p>The most pivotal catalytic characteristics of ureases are the cysteinyl residues bearing thiol groups and Ni<sup>2+</sup> present in the active site of enzymes, crucially responsible for the enzymatic activity. So far, there are two well-defined urease protective agents frequently employed to probe the inhibition mechanism. One is the thiol-containing reagents including dithiol (DTT) and monothiols (e.g. L-cys and GSH), and the other is the inorganic compounds, such as BA (a classical competitive urease inhibitor) and NaF (a competitive slow binding urease inhibitor), which were reported to inhibit the urease by interacting with Ni<sup>2+</sup> in the urease active site. In equilibration with the urease, both types of protectors occupy the active site of urease to restrain the accessibility of inactivators to the active-site of urease. Specifically, the thiol reagents inhibit the urease via interaction with the active-site sulfhydryl group of urease, while inorganics have been defined as competitive inhibitors, binding to its active site Ni<sup>2+</sup> resulting in urease inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168944.ref029">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168944.ref030">30</xref>]. In the present study, the thiol-containing compounds were found to exhibit a more appreciable protective effect when compared with the inorganic compounds. The thiol protectors (DTT, GSH and L-cys) evidently slowed down the rate of inactivation, while the unconspicuous protection by inorganic compounds from the inactivation was observed, suggesting that the target of inhibition of urease by Pal was possibly the active-site sulfhydryl groups. Since the inhibitory effect of NaF or BA on HPU and JBU displayed a possible synergic mode between Pal and NaF or BA, it was further proved that the active site sulfhydryl group was the potential target responsible for urease inhibition process.</p>
<p>Enzyme kinetic study is pivotal for the determination of the inhibition mechanism and sites of inhibitory binding. The Lineweaver-Burk plot was used to study the inhibition type in enzyme kinetics. According to the variations of <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>M</italic></sub> and <italic>v</italic><sub><italic>max</italic></sub> from the Lineweaver-Burk plots, it was proposed that the kinetic behavior might be noncompetitive for both HPU and JBU, implying Pal and substrate both got access to the urease non-competitively. In addition, the anti-urease activity of Pal was significantly affected by the incubation time. However, the thiol protection against urease inactivation by Pal was not relevant to the incubation time, but closely related to the addition order of the incubators. The results showed that the thiol-protectors might quickly combine with the sulfhydryl groups and restrict the accessibility of the inhibitor. In order to further prove whether the inactivation was reversible, DTT was employed in the reactivation of Pal-inactivated urease assay. More obvious protective effect exerted by DTT was observed in JBU as compared with that of HPU. Particularly, nearly 80% of JBU activity was recovered, but only 46% of total enzymatic activity of HPU was suppressed by Pal. This might be due to the specificity in the mode of interaction between HPU and JBU [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168944.ref031">31</xref>].</p>
<p>Furthermore, it was also supported by molecular docking simulation. As the results depicted, Pal was found to make hydrogen bonding interactions with ARG-338 (HPU) and ARG-639 (JBU), which were located on the urease active-site mobile flap. However, the interaction with the active-site Ni<sup>2+</sup> was not found to be obvious. It was shown that 2-OCH<sub>3</sub> group affected the molecular conformation interacting with HPU, which enhanced the binding with ARG-338, a key residue reported previously as catalytic residue in the active site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168944.ref032">32</xref>], resulting in lowered enzymatic activity. As far as JBU was concerned, 2-OCH<sub>3</sub> and 3-OCH<sub>3</sub> groups were observed to interact with ARG-639, a key residue located at the mobile flap covering the active site, hence preserving the flap in the open conformation and leading to urease inactivation. Results from the molecular docking simulation further supported our earlier conclusion from the urease protection experiments and DTT re-activation assay, which suggested the pivotal participation of the active-site sulfhydryl group in the inactivation of urease by Pal.</p>
<p>Hence, our data indicated that the interaction with the sulfhydryl group of the active site of urease was closely associated with the anti-urease activity of Pal, which might be one of the mechanisms by which Pal inhibited the growth of <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic>. Pal derived from <italic>C</italic>. <italic>chinensis</italic> might play an important role in the protection and therapy of <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic>-related gastrointestinal disease. However, the more detailed underlying mechanism merited further investigation.</p>
<p>In China, Pal has been developed as a safe and effective anti-inflammatory agent in clinic for the treatment of gynecological inflammation, digestive inflammatory disorders and urinary infection, etc. Previous study indicated that the anti-ulcerogenic activity of Pal was better than that of the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>chinensis</italic> extract and its active principle berberine, and the <italic>in vivo</italic> anti-<italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> activity of Pal and berberine was similar to that of ampicillin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168944.ref020">20</xref>]. It was also found that the toxicity of Pal was the minimal among the four major <italic>C</italic>. <italic>chinensis</italic> alkaloids (berberine, coptisine, palmatine and epiberberine), while berberine was relatively more toxic in both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> assays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168944.ref033">33</xref>]. In our previous investigation, the IC<sub>50</sub> of berberine against HPU and JBU was 10.20 ¬± 1.10 mM and above 13.00 mM, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0168944.ref008">8</xref>], indicating the anti-urease activity of berberine was weaker as compared with that of Pal. Hence, it was concluded that Pal might exert more potent gastroprotective, anti-<italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> and urease-inhibitory effect than berberine, and had a more favorable safety profile.</p>
<p>The current first-line monotherapeutic agent for <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> treatment either focuses on the direct anti-<italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> effect or gastroprotective property, and none of them harbor simultaneous anti-<italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic>, HPU-inhibitory and gastroprotective activities. Based on its simultaneous anti-<italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic>, HPU-inhibitory and gastroprotective properties, Pal was believed to possess good potential for further development into a safe and efficacious non-antibiotic therapeutic agent in the management of <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic>-related gastrointestinal disorders, and the discovery of Pal as a safe and efficacious urease inhibitor and rational characterization of its underlying mechanisms will undoubtedly add new therapeutic dimensions to its current clinical application and also provide a foundation and justification for further research as a potential complementary therapeutic agent to the current conventional medications.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>It was concluded that palmatine might suppress <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> growth, at least in part, through inhibition of its urease. The concentration-dependent, reversible, and noncompetitive inhibition against urease by palmatine might be attributed to its interaction with the sulfhydryl group of the active site of urease. Our work gave additional scientific support to the use of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>chinensis</italic> to treat <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic>-related gastrointestinal disorders and might extend the clinical indications of palmatine. Palmatine deserves to be further exploited as a promising naturally-occuring urease inhibitor for the treatment of <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> infection and other urease-related diseases.</p>
