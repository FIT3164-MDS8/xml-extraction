<p>The <italic>KRAS</italic> proto-oncogene plays a key role in the development of many human tumors and is commonly activated by somatic mutation or signaling through specific growth factor receptors. However, the interaction between the micro-environment and K-ras activity has not been defined. Hypoxia invariably develops as tumors outgrow their supply of oxygen. A series of well-orchestrated cellular adaptations occur that stimulate angiogenesis and enhance survival of the tumor in hypoxic conditions. Our previous studies demonstrated that mutant <italic>KRAS</italic> alleles can interact with hypoxia to induce vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in colon cancer. We sought to determine whether similar hypoxic responses are also present in tumors without a <italic>KRAS</italic> mutation. Hypoxia consistently increased the levels of activated, GTP-bound K-ras in colon cancer cell lines with a wild-type <italic>KRAS</italic> gene, and this depended upon the activation of c-Src. Inhibition of c-Src by PP2 treatment or siRNA knockdown blocked the hypoxic activation of K-ras. This activation of K-ras did not depend upon EGFR and resulted in the phosphorylation of Akt and induction of VEGF expression. In addition, activation of K-ras significantly blocked apoptosis in hypoxic conditions. These studies reveal a unique adaptive mechanism in hypoxia that activates K-ras signaling in the absence of a mutant <italic>KRAS</italic> oncogene.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The development of tissue hypoxia is characteristically observed as malignant tumors rapidly increase in size. Such hypoxic conditions exert selective pressure on cancer cells, and the ability of tumor cells to survive in a hypoxic microenvironment has been associated with a poor prognosis and resistance to therapy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0010966-Vaupel1">[1]</xref>. One of the most critical and best characterized responses to hypoxia is the induction of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) is a well-established mediator of this process. However, previous studies have demonstrated that HIF-independent mechanisms can also induce VEGF in hypoxia, and oncogenic K-ras plays a key role in this process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0010966-Zhang1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0010966-Mizukami1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0010966-Mizukami2">[4]</xref>.</p>
<p>K-ras is a small GTPase that cycles between inactive guanosine diphosphate (GDP)-bound and active guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-bound conformations (Ras-GDP and Ras-GTP, respectively) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0010966-Boguski1">[5]</xref>. It serves as a signal switch molecule that couples receptor activation by specific growth factors with downstream effector pathways including the Ras-MEK-ERK and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt cascades that control multiple cellular responses. Oncogenic mutations in <italic>KRAS</italic> impair the ability of K-Ras to hydrolyze bound GTP in a growth factor-independent manner, and constitutive signaling through these effector pathways results. The tumor microenvironment can have a profound influence on cellular behavior, and hypoxia has been shown to interact with many oncogenic signaling pathways. In particular, hypoxic activation of the PI3K-Akt, MEK-ERK, NF-ÎºB, and hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) signaling pathways has been described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0010966-Berra1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0010966-Blancher1">[7]</xref>. Although K-ras is a central regulator in all these pathways, it is unknown whether K-ras itself is specifically activated by hypoxia. Previous studies have demonstrated a strong synergistic interaction between hypoxia and mutant K-ras in the regulation of multiple target genes including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), IL-8, and osteopontin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0010966-Zhang1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0010966-Xu1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0010966-Zhu1">[9]</xref>. However, fewer than 50% of colon tumors harbor <italic>KRAS</italic> mutations, and the relationship between Ras signaling and hypoxia in tumors with wild-type <italic>KRAS</italic> remains undefined.</p>
<p>We sought to determine the role of K-ras in the hypoxic micro-environment in colon cancer, a tumor type that frequently harbors <italic>KRAS</italic> mutations. Wild-type K-ras was strongly activated by hypoxia, and c-Src was necessary for this hypoxic activation of K-ras. This resulted in the phosphorylation of Akt and induction of VEGF expression. In addition, hypoxic activation of wild-type K-ras blocked apoptosis. Collectively, these findings highlight a new mechanism for the hypoxic activation of oncogenic survival pathways in the absence of an oncogenic mutation.</p>

<title>Hypoxic activation of K-Ras in colon cancer cells</title>
<p>To determine whether hypoxia activates Ras, we measured GTP-bound Ras in normoxic and hypoxic conditions in a panel of colon cancer cell lines. Levels of GTP-bound Ras were barely detectable in Caco2, HT29, Colo320DM and Colo205 cells in normoxic conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010966-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). All of these lines have a wild-type <italic>KRAS</italic> gene. However, when these cells were incubated in hypoxic conditions (1% O<sub>2</sub>), there was a dramatic increase (from 3 to 6.8 fold) in the levels of activated Ras (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010966-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). In contrast, the basal activities of Ras in DLD1, HCT116 (both heterozygous for the <italic>KRAS<sup>D13</sup></italic> mutation), and SW480 (homozygous for the <italic>KRAS<sup>V12</sup></italic> mutation) cells in normoxia were high, and there was no subsequent increase in hypoxia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010966-g001">Fig. 1A, right panel</xref>). SW480 cells had the strongest levels of Ras activation in normoxic conditions. Hypoxia is thus a strong activator of Ras in colon cancer cells, but this induction was observed only in those cells with a wild-type <italic>KRAS</italic> gene.</p>

<title>Hypoxia activates Ras in colon cancer cell lines with a wild-type <italic>KRAS</italic>.</title>
<p>The levels of GTP-bound Ras (<bold>A</bold>) and GTP-bound K-ras (<bold>B</bold>) were evaluated in wild-type (left panel) and mutant (right panel) <italic>KRAS</italic> cell lines grown either in normoxic (N) or hypoxic (H) conditions for 4 hours. Two milligrams of cell extracts were used for a Ras activation assay, followed by Western blotting with the indicated antibodies. Densitometry values are expressed as fold change compared with control values normalized to 1. <bold>C</bold>, Caco2 cells were cultured in DMEM with pH adjusted to 7.5 or 6.5 for 4 hours. Cell lysates were used for a Ras activation assay followed by Western blotting with a Ras-GTP specific antibody. Densitometry values are expressed as fold change compared with control values normalized to 1.</p>

<p>To verify that the K-ras isoform was activated by hypoxia, a K-ras specific antibody was utilized. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010966-g001">Figure 1B</xref>, levels of GTP bound-K-ras were induced by hypoxia in colon cancer cells with wild-type <italic>KRAS</italic> (Caco2, HT29) whereas there were no changes in cell lines with a mutant <italic>KRAS</italic> oncogene (DLD1, HCT116, SW480). A role for N-ras in the regulation of apoptosis has been suggested in colon cancer, but an N-ras specific antibody failed to detect GTP-bound-N-ras in Caco2, DLD1, and HCT116 cell lines in either normoxic or hypoxic conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0010966.s001">Fig. S1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0010966-Haigis1">[10]</xref>.</p>
<p>Tumor hypoxia is often accompanied by a switch to anaerobic glycolysis and a lower pH, so we investigated whether the hypoxic regulation of Ras activity was mediated through changes in pH. Incubation of Caco2 cells in acidic conditions (pH 6.5) for 4 hours did not increase the activity of Ras, suggesting that changes in pH do not regulate levels of GTP-bound Ras (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010966-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>).</p>
</sec><sec id="s2b">
<title>Upregulation of Ras activity by hypoxia requires c-Src</title>
<p>c-Src lies upstream of K-ras, and we next sought to explore whether c-Src is also activated by hypoxia. A time-dependent activation of c-Src, as measured by phosphorylation at Tyr<sup>416</sup>, was observed in both Caco2 and HT29 cells after incubation in hypoxic conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010966-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). To determine if c-Src activity contributed to the activation of Ras by hypoxia, we pretreated Caco2 cells with PP2, a potent and selective Src tyrosine kinase inhibitor. A 50% reduction in the hypoxic induction of Ras was detected in Caco2 cells, while there was no effect on the levels of total Ras (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010966-g002">Fig. 2B, left panel</xref>). This effect was dose-dependent, with a maximal effect seen at 20 ÂµM (data not shown).</p>

<p>To more directly assess the role of c-Src, we knocked down endogenous c-Src in Caco2 cells via RNA interference. Knock-down of c-Src led to a 33% reduction in the hypoxic activation of GTP-bound Ras (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010966-g002">Fig. 2B, right panel</xref>). Furthermore, Caco2 cells expressing a constitutively active c-Src vector (SrcY527F) exhibited a 70% increase in the level of GTP-bound Ras (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010966-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>) when compared with empty vector (pEVX). Western blotting verified the K-ras isoform was activated by expression of Src (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0010966.s002">Fig. S2</xref>).</p>
<p>Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by hypoxia have previously been shown to activate Src. Exogenous administration of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (5 mM) potently induced phosphorylation of Src at Tyr<sup>416</sup> in Caco2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010966-g002">Fig. 2D, left panel</xref>). This effect was significantly reduced by NAC (20 mM), an antioxidant that inhibits ROS. We then sought to determine whether NAC could block the hypoxic activation of endogenous Src and Ras. NAC treatment reduced the induction of p-Src<sup>416</sup> in hypoxia by approximately 30% with a concomitant 17% reduction of GTP-bound Ras (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010966-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>). These findings suggest that generation of ROS may partially contribute to the hypoxic activation of c-Src in colon cancer cells.</p>
<p>Recent reports have suggested that hypoxia can increase levels of EGFR and that phosphorylation of EGFR may be an intermediate step in the signaling from Src to Ras <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0010966-Franovic1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0010966-Wu1">[12]</xref>. To determine whether EGFR may play such a role, we measured total EGFR and phospho-EGFR levels in Caco2 cells incubated in hypoxia. There was a small increase in total EGFR in hypoxia. However, there was no increase in EGFR phosphorylation at Tyr<sup>1068</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010966-g002">Fig. 2E</xref>). Overall, the data suggest that up-regulation of c-Src activity by hypoxia is mediated in part through ROS but that activation of K-Ras by c-Src in hypoxia does not depend upon EGFR.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2c">
<title>Activation of Akt by hypoxia is downstream of c-Src and K-ras</title>
<p>We next sought to determine which downstream effector pathways were activated by c-Src and K-ras in hypoxia. Exposure to hypoxic conditions induced phosphorylation of Akt at Ser<sup>473</sup> in both Caco2 and HT29 cells, while no activation of ERK was detected under the same conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010966-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). Akt was activated in a time-dependent manner and reached a maximum level at 12 hours. To determine whether Src was involved in the hypoxic activation of Akt, we pretreated Caco2 cells with the specific Src inhibitor PP2 for 12 hours before exposure to hypoxia. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010966-g003">Figure 3B</xref>, the hypoxic activation of Akt was reduced by PP2 treatment in a dose-dependent manner. Consistent with these findings, knock down of c-Src also completely blocked the hypoxic activation of Akt when compared to cells transfected with a control siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010966-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>).</p>

Densitometry values for p-Akt are expressed as fold change compared with control values normalized to 1. <bold>B</bold>, Caco2 cells were incubated for 1 hour with PP2 at the concentrations indicated, before transfer to normoxic or hypoxic conditions for 12 hours.

<p>Because Akt is known to be downstream of K-ras, we tested whether Akt is also a specific target of K-ras under hypoxic conditions by utilizing K-ras siRNA oligos. Silencing of K-ras reduced the levels of Akt in hypoxia when compared to cells transfected with control siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010966-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>). These data indicate that hypoxic activation of Akt is mediated through both Src and K-ras. No changes in phospho-Src<sup>416</sup> and total Src protein levels were observed when K-ras was silenced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010966-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>), indicating that Src is indeed upstream of K-ras in this hypoxic signaling pathway.</p>
<p>To independently verify that K-ras was downstream of Src in this hypoxia-induced phosphorylation of Akt, we performed experiments in a Caco2 cell line stably expressing the mutant oncogene <italic>KRAS<sup>V12</sup></italic> (Caco2/pCSGWK-rasV12). The hypoxic induction of p-Akt was not blocked by silencing of c-Src with siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010966-g003">Fig. 3D</xref>). These findings indicate that c-Src functions upstream of K-ras in the hypoxic activation of Akt.</p>

<title>K-ras and Src mediate resistance to apoptosis in hypoxia</title>
<p>Akt plays a pivotal role in regulating apoptosis and cell cycle progression. Since Akt is a downstream target of K-ras in this hypoxia-triggered intracellular signaling pathway, we sought to determine whether silencing of K-ras would affect cell survival. Knock-down of K-ras decreased cell viability even in normoxic conditions by 20% in HCT116 cells, but there were no significant changes in DLD1 or Caco2 cells. In contrast, K-ras knockdown in hypoxic conditions reduced cell counts to a much greater extent: a 40% reduction in HCT116 (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05) and 50% reductions in DLD1 and Caco2 cells (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.01) were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010966-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). Silencing of K-ras in Caco2 cells resulted in a survival rate in hypoxia comparable to DLD1 and HCT116 cells that harbor a mutant <italic>KRAS</italic> gene, suggesting that the wild-type K-ras protein also plays an important role in the adaptive mechanism in hypoxia.</p>

<p>We then labeled cells with FITC-conjugated annexin V and propidium iodide (PI) to measure rates of apoptosis. Another wild-type <italic>KRAS</italic> cell line, Colo320DM, was studied because its growth pattern as single cells permits visualization of apoptotic membrane changes more clearly. Silencing of K-ras resulted in alterations in cell morphology, including blebbing, shrinkage, and nuclear fragmentation, as well as reduced attachment to the tissue culture dish and increased floating. Silencing of K-ras also increased the number of Annexin V positive cells compared with control siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010966-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). To quantify the anti-apoptotic effects of K-ras in hypoxia, we analyzed apoptotic cell populations by flow cytometry (FACS). Caco2 cells transfected with either a non targeting control or K-ras siRNA oligos were incubated in normoxia or hypoxia for 48 hours. Cells without any treatment served as a negative control, and cells exposed to UV light for 10 minutes and cultured with TNF-Î± and Cycloheximide (CHX) served as a positive control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010966-g004">Fig. 4C, left panel</xref>). A histogram of Annexin V-FITC positive cells revealed that knock-down of K-ras in normoxia did not significantly alter rates of apoptosis. However, under hypoxic conditions, loss of K-ras significantly increased rates of cell death from 22% to 57% when compared with control siRNA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010966-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>, middle and right panel). We further analyzed the apoptotic cells as two subpopulations: early apoptotic cells (Annexin V+, PI-) and late apoptotic/necrotic cells (Annexin V+, PI+). Only when K-ras was knocked-down under hypoxic conditions was a significant induction of apoptosis observed by FACS analysis; there was a 1.3-fold increase in the number of early apoptotic cells (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05) and 2.0-fold increase in the number of late apoptotic cells (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.01) when compared to control siRNA in hypoxia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010966-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>). These studies indicate that K-ras can inhibit apoptosis in hypoxia.</p>
<p>Our data suggested that Src may also regulate survival pathways that block apoptosis in hypoxia. We defined the relationship between Src and cell survival directly by counting viable cells that excluded trypan blue. Knock-down of Src in DLD1 and HCT116 cells did not alter cell survival in normoxia (1% and 9% reductions in cell counts, respectively), whereas in hypoxia, cell counts decreased by 36% and 45%, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010966-g004">Fig. 4E</xref>). Similarly, knockdown of c-Src in Caco2 cells reduced cell counts by 20% in normoxia compared to a more significant 58% reduction in hypoxia. Therefore, the activation of K-ras or Src under hypoxic conditions enhances the survival of colon cancer cells.</p>

<title>Hypoxic regulation of VEGF by K-ras</title>
<p>Hypoxia is also a potent stimulus for angiogenesis through the induction of VEGF. We previously demonstrated that hypoxia and oncogenic K-ras can synergistically up-regulate VEGF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0010966-Zhang1">[2]</xref>. While such studies provide invaluable insights into oncogenic K-ras function, they do not provide insights into mechanisms that colon cancer cells with a wild-type <italic>KRAS</italic> may utilize. We therefore inhibited the endogenous wild-type <italic>KRAS</italic> in Caco2 cells with siRNA oligos to define the relationship between K-ras activation and VEGF production. In Caco2 cells transfected with a control siRNA, hypoxia increased VEGF mRNA levels 4.9-fold. Knockdown of K-ras resulted in a decrease of VEGF mRNA expression by 60% and 76% in normoxic and hypoxic conditions, respectively, when compared to cells transfected with a control siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010966-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>). We next used a VEGF promoter reporter construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010966-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>). Hypoxic conditions induced VEGF promoter activity by 2.2 fold. Consistent with our qRT-PCR results, silencing of K-ras dramatically reduced the hypoxic induction of VEGF promoter activity by 72%. In normoxia, there was a 38% reduction in VEGF promoter activity after K-ras silencing. This decrease in VEGF promoter activity correlated with the changes seen in K-ras activation. Finally, an ELISA assay demonstrated that secreted VEGF protein levels were up-regulated 2.6-fold by hypoxia. Knockdown of wild-type <italic>KRAS</italic> in Caco2 cells decreased VEGF protein levels by only 8% in normoxia but reduced VEGF protein levels more significantly in hypoxia by 51% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010966-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>). These results suggest that a wild-type <italic>KRAS</italic> gene is also a critical regulator of VEGF in hypoxic conditions.</p>

<p>To verify the specific role of c-Src in the hypoxic induction of VEGF, we utilized Src siRNA oligos. With this approach, mRNA levels of VEGF were unchanged in normoxic conditions but reduced by 39% in hypoxia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010966-g006">Fig. 6C</xref>), and VEGF promoter activity decreased 56% compared with a 33% decrease in normoxia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010966-g006">Fig. 6D</xref>). To confirm this effect was not unique to Caco2 cells, HT29 cells were also analyzed. Treatment with PP2 or Src siRNA oligos in HT29 cells under normoxic conditions had negligible effects on VEGF mRNA or promoter activity. In contrast, under hypoxic conditions, PP2 suppressed VEGF mRNA levels and promoter activity by 67% and 53%, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010966-g006">Fig. 6A and 6B, right panel</xref>s); similarly, c-Src siRNA oligos reduced VEGF mRNA levels and promoter activity by 37% and 76% in hypoxia, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010966-g006">Fig. 6C and 6D, right panel</xref>s).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Hypoxia is an unavoidable consequence of rapid tumor growth that outstrips the existing blood supply. A carefully orchestrated set of adaptive responses ensures survival of the tumor cell in these hypoxic conditions. The HIF-1 transcription factor is known to play a role in this hypoxic response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0010966-Bertout1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0010966-Giaccia1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0010966-Semenza1">[15]</xref>. We sought to determine whether additional oncogenic pathways may enhance these adaptive responses. In colon cancer, previous studies have demonstrated a synergistic interaction between <italic>KRAS</italic> mutations and hypoxia in the regulation of multiple genes including VEGF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0010966-Zhang1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0010966-Xu1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0010966-Zhu1">[9]</xref>. However, <italic>KRAS</italic> mutations are identified in less than half of all colon cancers, and the role of wild-type <italic>KRAS</italic> in the hypoxic response is less certain. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of the hypoxic activation of K-ras in colon cancer.</p>
<p>Our data demonstrate that hypoxia is a potent activator of wild-type K-Ras in colon cancer cells. Activation of K-ras resulted in the downstream activation of Akt, induction of VEGF, and inhibition of apoptosis. These effects on angiogenesis as well as apoptosis are both critical for tumor survival in conditions of sustained hypoxia. The recruitment of the Akt pathway is consistent with previous reports of hypoxic signaling by mutant K-ras in the regulation of OPN gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0010966-Zhu1">[9]</xref>. K-ras can activate hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) through protein phosphorylation, and some of the observed effects on the induction of VEGF may potentially be mediated through HIF-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0010966-Sodhi1">[16]</xref>. However, it is unlikely that HIF-1 is the only mediator of this process, as K-ras can also regulate VEGF through HIF-1 independent pathways in hypoxia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0010966-Mizukami3">[17]</xref>.</p>
<p>The activation of K-ras in hypoxia depended upon the upstream activation of c-Src. There is a precedent for the hypoxic activation of Src, which has been demonstrated both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> in other cell types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0010966-Pham1">[18]</xref>. There are a number of specific mediators that link Src to K-ras, and a role for the activation of EGFR is well-described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0010966-Franovic1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0010966-Lei1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0010966-Wang1">[20]</xref>. Despite its established link to colonic tumorigenesis, EGFR does not play a role in the hypoxic activation of K-ras.</p>
<p>Cellular responses to hypoxia seek to preserve survival in a hostile microenvironment. The activation of K-ras in hypoxic conditions implies a key role in the hypoxic response, and our studies highlight two important functions: inhibition of apoptosis and stimulation of angiogenesis. The role of K-ras in the regulation of apoptosis is highly dependent upon context and cell type. In some cases, K-ras can be pro-apoptotic through the activation of RASSF1 or Nore1, but in other scenarios it may serve anti-apoptotic functions through PI3K or Tiam1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0010966-Cox1">[21]</xref>. Our studies in colon cancer cells demonstrate a key role for activation of the Akt pathway in hypoxia, which has been previously shown to block apoptosis in other cellular systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0010966-Cho1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0010966-Jiang1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0010966-Lee1">[24]</xref>. Interestingly, ERK was not activated by hypoxia in our system. The role of ERK activation in colon tumors is not straightforward. Although expression of oncogenic K-ras in normal colonic epithelial cells can strongly activate ERK <italic>in vivo</italic>, only limited ERK signaling was observed in colon tumors that developed in these animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0010966-Haigis1">[10]</xref>. In addition, colon cancer cells carrying a K-ras mutation failed to demonstrate significant activation of ERK, and no reliable correlation between <italic>KRAS</italic> mutation status and ERK activation has been observed in human colon cancer samples <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0010966-Haigis1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0010966-Yeh1">[25]</xref>. The specific mechanisms that determine which effector pathways are engaged by K-ras in hypoxic versus normoxic conditions remain to be defined and illustrates the plasticity of K-ras function depending upon specific micro-environmental cues.</p>
<p>Hypoxic conditions can therefore create a milieu in which proto-oncogenes that are not mutated can mimic activated oncogenes. Even though wild-type K-ras can be activated by hypoxia, it is likely that its spectrum of activity does not entirely overlap with that of mutant K-ras and there are other properties specific to oncogenic <italic>KRAS</italic> alleles. Activation of Akt in hypoxia appears to be a common feature of colon tumors with or without <italic>KRAS</italic> mutations, but it has become clear that mutant K-ras and physiologically activated wild-type K-ras do not function identically <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0010966-Singh1">[26]</xref>. Nevertheless, these findings indicate a critical role for wild-type <italic>KRAS</italic> alleles in hypoxia and provide a potential explanation for the aggressive behavior of tumor cells that can survive in the hypoxic microenvironment.</p>
