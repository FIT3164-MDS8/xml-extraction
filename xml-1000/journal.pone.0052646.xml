      <abstract>
        <p>Biofilm formation and dispersal in the black rot pathogen <italic>Xanthomonas campestris</italic> pathovar <italic>campestris</italic> (<italic>Xcc</italic>) is influenced by a number of factors. The extracellular mannanase ManA has been implicated in biofilm dispersal whereas biofilm formation requires a putative glycosyl transferase encoded by the <italic>xag</italic> gene cluster. Previously we demonstrated that the post-transcriptional regulator RsmA exerts a negative regulatory influence on biofilm formation in <italic>Xcc</italic>. Here we address the mechanisms by which RsmA exerts this action. We show that RsmA binds to the transcripts of three genes encoding GGDEF domain diguanylate cyclases to influence their expression. Accordingly, mutation of <italic>rsmA</italic> leads to an increase in cellular levels of cyclic di-GMP. This effect is associated with a down-regulation of transcription of <italic>manA</italic>, but an upregulation of <italic>xag</italic> gene transcription. Mutation of <italic>clp</italic>, which encodes a cyclic di-GMP-responsive transcriptional regulator of the CRP-FNR family, has similar divergent effects on the expression of <italic>manA</italic> and <italic>xag</italic>. Nevertheless Clp binding to <italic>manA</italic> and <italic>xag</italic> promoters is inhibited by cyclic di-GMP. The data support the contention that, in common with other CRP-FNR family members, Clp can act as both an activator and repressor of transcription of different genes to influence biofilm formation as a response to cyclic di-GMP.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The formation, maturation and dispersal of biofilms are key processes within the lifestyle of many bacteria including animal and plant pathogens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052646-Costerton1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052646-OToole1">[2]</xref>. Biofilm formation is important for many pathogenic organisms, as bacteria within these multicellular structures are often considerably more resistant to diverse stresses that can include the action of host defences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052646-Costerton1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052646-OToole1">[2]</xref>. Equally the release of bacteria from biofilms is significant for the progression of disease into uninfected tissue and for completion of the disease cycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052646-Monds1">[3]</xref>. The extracellular environment undoubtedly influences many aspects of bacterial behaviour including the dynamics of biofilm formation and dispersal. An array of signal transduction systems link the sensing of specific environmental cues to appropriate alterations in bacterial physiology and/or gene expression. An understanding of these different regulatory elements or pathways, how they are integrated and how they act to influence biofilm dynamics may have important implications for the control of bacterial disease.</p>
      <p><italic>Xanthomonas campestris</italic> pathovar <italic>campestris</italic> (hereafter <italic>Xcc</italic>) is the causative agent of black rot disease of cruciferous plants, which is an important disease globally <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052646-Ryan1">[4]</xref>. A number of factors and several regulatory pathways have been implicated in the formation or dispersal of biofilms by <italic>Xcc</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052646-Dow1">[5]</xref>. Biofilm formation requires the synthesis of the extracellular polysaccharide xanthan and an uncharacterised polysaccharide whose synthesis is directed by the products of the <italic>xag</italic> gene cluster <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052646-Tao1">[6]</xref>. Conversely, the extracellular enzyme beta (1,4)-mannanase has been implicated in biofilm dispersal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052646-Dow1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052646-Tao1">[6]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Cell-to-cell signalling mediated by the diffusible signal molecule DSF (for Diffusible Signal Factor; <italic>cis</italic>-11-methyl-dodecenoic acid) regulates biofilm dispersal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052646-Dow1">[5]</xref>. Both the synthesis and perception of the DSF signal require products of the <italic>rpf</italic> gene cluster (for <underline>r</underline>egulation of <underline>p</underline>athogenicity <underline>f</underline>actors). The synthesis of DSF is dependent on RpfF, whereas the two-component system comprising the sensor kinase RpfC and regulator RpfG is implicated in DSF perception and signal transduction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052646-Barber1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052646-Slater1">[8]</xref>. RpfG is a regulator with a CheY-like receiver (REC) domain attached to an HD-GYP domain, which acts to degrade the second messenger bis (3â€², 5â€²)-cyclic diguanosine monophosphate (cyclic di-GMP) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052646-Ryan2">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052646-Ryan3">[10]</xref>. Mutation of <italic>rpfF</italic>, <italic>rpfG</italic>, or <italic>rpfC</italic> leads to an elevated level of cyclic di-GMP and the mutants exhibit an aggregative behaviour when grown in certain media, unlike the wild-type, which grows in a dispersed fashion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052646-Ryan1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052646-Dow1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052646-Ryan2">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052646-Ryan4">[11]</xref>. This is consistent with a body of work in a number of bacteria in which biofilm formation has been associated with elevated levels of cyclic di-GMP (reviewed recently by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052646-Hengge1">[12]</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052646-Ryan5">[16]</xref>).</p>
      <p>The Rpf/DSF system positively influences the expression of the <italic>manA</italic> gene, encoding endo-mannanase, but negatively influences the expression of the <italic>xag</italic> gene cluster <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052646-Tao1">[6]</xref>. The regulatory effect of the DSF/<italic>rpf</italic> system on the expression of <italic>manA</italic> is believed to involve the transcriptional regulator Clp <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052646-Hsiao1">[17]</xref>. Elevated levels of cyclic di-GMP negatively influence the ability of Clp to bind to DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052646-Leduc1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052646-Gomelsky1">[19]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In previous work we have shown that the post-transcriptional regulator RsmA also influences biofilm formation in <italic>Xcc.</italic> RsmA is an RNA-binding protein functioning as a global regulator of various cellular processes in bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052646-Romeo1">[20]</xref>. Deletion of <italic>rsmA</italic> in <italic>Xcc</italic> results in complete loss of virulence, a significant reduction in the production of the extracellular polysaccharide xanthan and extracellular enzymes including mannanase but an enhanced bacterial aggregation and cell adhesion. Mutation of <italic>rsmA</italic> does not alter the expression of <italic>rpf</italic> genes or the level of DSF in <italic>Xcc</italic> however, suggesting that the regulatory action of RsmA on biofilm formation is independent of cell-to-cell signalling under the conditions tested <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052646-Chao1">[21]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In this paper we address the mechanisms by which RsmA exerts a regulatory effect on biofilm formation in <italic>Xcc</italic>. In <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and <italic>Salmonella,</italic> the RsmA homolog CsrA controls cyclic di-GMP metabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052646-Romeo1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052646-Jonas1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052646-Jonas2">[23]</xref>. Our initial finding that mutation of <italic>rsmA</italic> in <italic>Xcc</italic> also leads to an increase in levels of cyclic di-GMP prompted us to study the influence of RsmA on expression of genes in <italic>Xcc</italic> encoding GGDEF, EAL or HD-GYP domain proteins that are involved in cyclic di-GMP synthesis or degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052646-Hengge1">[12]</xref>. This allowed us to define a subset of these proteins whose expression is regulated by RsmA. Further to this we demonstrate by mutational analysis that Clp has opposite effects on the expression of <italic>manA</italic> and <italic>xagA</italic> genes. The work defines a regulatory network controlling the formation of biofilms in <italic>Xcc</italic> that comprises elements that are likely to be responsive to diverse environmental cues.</p>

        <title>Mutation of <italic>rsmA</italic> Leads to an Alteration in Biofilm Formation and Increase in Cellular Level of Cyclic di-GMP</title>
        <p>We have previously shown that mutation of <italic>rsmA</italic> in <italic>Xcc</italic> leads to an aggregative behaviour in liquid media and enhanced adhesion to glass surfaces <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052646-Chao1">[21]</xref>. This biofilm phenotype was assayed quantitatively using crystal violet staining to measure adherence to glass (see <italic>Methods</italic>). As expected, the <italic>rsmA</italic> mutant showed aggregative behaviour in liquid medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052646-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>) and had higher levels of biofilm formation on glass than the wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052646-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). Complementation with <italic>rsmA</italic> expressed <italic>in trans</italic> restored the phenotypes to wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052646-g001">Fig. 1A,B</xref>). In parallel, we measured the level of cyclic di-GMP in wild-type, <italic>rsmA</italic> mutant and complemented strains (see <italic>Methods</italic>). The cellular level of cyclic di-GMP in the <italic>rsmA</italic> mutant was elevated over that seen in the wild-type. Introduction of the cloned <italic>rsmA</italic> gene (pRSMA) into the <italic>rsmA</italic> mutant reduced the cyclic di-GMP level to wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052646-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>).</p>

        <title>RsmA Binds to the Transcripts of Genes Encoding GGDEF Domain Proteins to Influence Expression</title>
        <p>The finding that mutation of <italic>rsmA</italic> led to an increase in cellular levels of cyclic di-GMP prompted us to study the influence of RsmA on expression of all 37 genes in <italic>Xcc</italic> encoding proteins involved in cyclic di-GMP turnover: diguanylate cyclases with a GGDEF domain and phosphodiesterases with an EAL or HD-GYP domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052646-Ryan6">[24]</xref>. The regulatory influence of RmsA on cyclic di-GMP metabolism could be exerted directly, through binding to transcripts of genes encoding these proteins, although more indirect regulation is certainly possible. In order to address these issues, we examined the effect of <italic>rsmA</italic> mutation on the transcription of genes encoding proteins with GGDEF, EAL or HD-GYP domains by qRT-PCR and also assessed the physical binding of RsmA to transcripts by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA).</p>
        <p>Mutation of <italic>rsmA</italic> led to an alteration in the transcript level of seven genes (<italic>XC_0831</italic>, <italic>XC_1803, XC_1824, XC_2228, XC_2715, XC_2324</italic> and <italic>XC_2866</italic>), which were all elevated in the mutant compared to the wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052646-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). These genes encode proteins with a GGDEF domain or with both GGDEF and EAL domains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0052646.s001">Fig. S1</xref>). The EMSA assays showed that RsmA interacted directly with the transcripts of five of these genes (<italic>XC_1803, XC_1824, XC_2228, XC_2715</italic> and <italic>XC_2866</italic>). However RsmA did not interact with transcripts of <italic>XC_0831</italic> or <italic>XC_2324</italic> or with any gene whose transcript level was unaltered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052646-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). The mobility shifts were reversed by competition with unlabelled RNA of the same sequence, but not by unrelated RNAs (data not shown), which indicated that the interactions were specific.</p>

        <title>Mutation of Genes Encoding Target GGDEF Domain Proteins Reduces the Level of Cyclic di-GMP in the <italic>rsmA</italic> Background</title>
        <p>The elevated expression of the GGDEF domain proteins XC_1803, XC_2715 and XC_2866 in the <italic>rsmA</italic> mutant suggested that these putative diguanylate cyclases were responsible for the higher cellular level of cyclic di-GMP in this strain. In the first step towards testing this hypothesis, all three GGDEF domain proteins were purified as His6-tagged proteins and their activity in cyclic di-GMP synthesis was assessed (see Supporting Information). All three proteins were active as diguanylate cyclases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0052646.s002">Fig. S2</xref>). Following this, the effect of mutation of <italic>XC_1803, XC_2715</italic> and <italic>XC_2866,</italic> both singly and in combination on the level of cyclic di-GMP in the <italic>rsmA</italic> mutant of <italic>Xcc</italic> was examined. The findings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052646-g005">Fig. 5</xref>) showed that although single mutations had no effect, double mutants reduced the level towards wild-type, while the triple mutation reduced the level of cyclic di-GMP in the <italic>rsmA</italic> mutant to wild-type levels. The triple mutation in the wild-type background had little effect on the cyclic di-GMP levels however. These findings link alteration in level of the three GGDEF domain proteins in the <italic>rsmA</italic> mutant to alteration in cyclic di-GMP.</p>

        <title>Cyclic di-GMP Influences Expression of <italic>manA</italic> and <italic>xagA</italic> Genes in a Clp-dependent Manner</title>
        <p>The findings outlined above raise the question of how the elevation of levels of cyclic di-GMP in the <italic>rsmA</italic> mutant is linked to the formation of biofilms in <italic>Xcc</italic>. One possible link is through the cyclic di-GMP-responsive transcriptional regulator Clp (XC_0486).

        <p>The possible action of Clp as a repressor of <italic>xag</italic> gene expression was further investigated using a <italic>xag-gusA</italic> fusion in which the promoter of <italic>xagA</italic> (211 nt) drives expression of <italic>gusA</italic> (see <italic>Methods</italic>).

In the <italic>clp</italic> mutant background however, both native and altered promoters gave similar levels of beta-galactosidase.

      <p>The work in this manuscript provides insight into the mechanisms by which the post-transcriptional regulator RsmA exerts a regulatory influence on biofilm formation in <italic>Xcc</italic>. The findings support a model by which RsmA influences the expression of three genes encoding GGDEF domain proteins that leads to alteration in cellular levels of cyclic di-GMP and consequent divergent effects on the expression of <italic>manA</italic> and <italic>xag</italic> mediated by the Clp transcriptional regulator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052646-g009">Fig. 9</xref>). The influence of RsmA on expression of specific GGDEF domain proteins is similar to that described previously in <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>Salmonella</italic>, where the RsmA homolog CsrA has been shown to directly influence expression of GGDEF domain proteins (Jonas et al., 2008; 2010). We do not exclude the possibility that RsmA has additional direct or indirect effects on <italic>manA</italic> or <italic>xagA</italic> gene expression however, although RsmA does not affect transcription of the <italic>clp</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0052646.s004">Fig. S4</xref>).</p>

          <title>Model of regulation of biofilm formation and aggregation in <italic>Xcc</italic> by RsmA.</title>
          <p>The post-transcriptional regulator RsmA influences the expression of three genes encoding GGDEF domain proteins (<italic>XC_1803, XC_2715</italic> and <italic>XC_2866</italic>) by binding to the transcripts. RsmA binding inhibits translation of these mRNAs. Inactivation of RsmA, perhaps by sequestration by small RNA species, allows translation to occur, leading to elevated cellular levels of cyclic di-GMP. The binding of cyclic di-GMP to the transcription factor Clp prevents DNA binding. This reduces expression of <italic>manA</italic>, which requires Clp for expression but activates expression of the <italic>xag</italic> genes for which Clp is a repressor. Since ManA promotes biofilm dispersal and the <italic>xag</italic> gene products promote biofilm formation, these effects contribute to enhanced biofilm formation and aggregation. Conversely, when RsmA binds to the transcripts of <italic>XC_1803, XC_2715</italic> and <italic>XC_2866,</italic> the cellular levels of cyclic di-GMP are lower, <italic>manA</italic> expression is favoured and <italic>xag</italic> gene expression is reduced. This leads to biofilm dispersal and planktonic growth. We do not exclude the possibility that RsmA has additional direct or indirect effects on <italic>manA</italic> or <italic>xag</italic> gene expression or that regulation by Clp is more indirect, for example by positive regulation of a distinct repressor protein or that other functions regulated by cyclic di-GMP also have a role.</p>

      <p>An intriguing observation in the current work is that mutation of <italic>clp</italic> leads to a down-regulation of expression of <italic>manA</italic> [5 and data not shown], that is associated with biofilm dispersal but an upregulation of <italic>xag</italic> gene expression, which is involved in biofilm formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052646-Tao1">[6]</xref>. The most parsimonious explanation for this finding is that Clp can act both as an activator and repressor of transcription of different genes. Similarly, other members of the CRP-FNR family (to which Clp belongs) have been shown to act both as activators and repressors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052646-Spiro1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052646-Milohanic1">[28]</xref>. The effects of mutation of the putative Clp box on expression of the <italic>xag</italic>-<italic>lacZ</italic> reporter is consistent with a direct role for Clp as a repressor but we cannot exclude the possibility that regulation of <italic>xag</italic> gene expression by Clp is more indirect, for example by positive regulation of a distinct repressor protein. It is noteworthy that mutation of <italic>clp</italic> does not lead to an aggregated phenotype in <italic>Xcc</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052646-He1">[29]</xref>; and data not shown). This suggests that regulation of Clp is necessary, but not sufficient for biofilm formation and that other cyclic di-GMP-influenced processes are also required.</p>
      <p>The formation of biofilms in many bacteria is responsive to diverse environmental cues or stimuli and several elements in the proposed regulatory pathway are likely to be responsive to such cues. A body of work on different bacteria has shown that small RNAs modulate the activity of RsmA (CsrA) by sequestration to prevent binding to transcripts of target genes. The small RNAs that are presumed to fulfil this role in <italic>Xcc</italic> have yet to be described. Importantly, in other bacteria, the synthesis of these regulatory RNAs is regulated by two component systems that recognise as yet unknown signals. RsmA in <italic>Xcc</italic> regulates expression of three GGDEF domain proteins, two of which contain additional domains: XC_1803 contains a GAF domain and XC_2715 has a putative periplasmic binding domain. This suggests that the enzymatic activities of these proteins in cyclic di-GMP synthesis are responsive to environmental cues.</p>
      <p>The Rpf/DSF cell-cell signalling system also influences biofilm dispersal and inversely regulates <italic>manA</italic> and <italic>xag</italic> gene expression. The Rpf/DSF system is linked to alterations in the level of cyclic di-GMP through the action of RpfG as a cyclic di-GMP phosphodiesterase. However RsmA does not influence DSF signalling in <italic>Xcc</italic> and Rpf/DSF does not act to regulate expression of <italic>XC_1803</italic>, <italic>XC_2715</italic> or <italic>XC_2866</italic>. This suggests that the DSF-dependent and RsmA-dependent pathways controlling biofilm dynamics intersect at the level of cyclic di-GMP, although other levels of interplay are possible.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, the work described in this paper adds to an understanding of mechanisms by which <italic>Xcc</italic> controls biofilm formation in response to diverse environmental signals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052646-Dow1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0052646-Tao1">[6]</xref>. Our knowledge of these processes remains fragmentary however and there a large number of questions that remain to be answered. For example, what is the substrate for ManA and what is the polymer whose synthesis is directed by the Xag proteins? What other factors are required for biofilm formation? Finally (and of particular relevance to the work described here), what are the small RNAs that we presume to act to modulate RsmA action and how are they in turn regulated?</p>
