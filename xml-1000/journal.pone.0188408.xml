<abstract>
<p>Plant responses induced by herbivore damage can provide fitness benefits, but can also have important costs due to altered interactions with mutualist pollinators. We examined the effects of plant responses to herbivory in a hummingbird-pollinated distylous shrub, <italic>Palicourea angustifolia</italic>. Through a series of field experiments we investigated whether damage from foliar herbivores leads to a reduction in fruit set, influences floral visitation, or alters floral traits that may influence pollinator preference or pollinator efficiency. Foliar herbivory by a generalist grasshopper led to reduced fruit set in branches that were directly damaged as well as in adjacent undamaged branches on the same plant. Furthermore, herbivory resulted in reduced floral visitation from two common hummingbird species and two bee species. An investigation into the potential mechanisms behind reduced floral visitation in induced plants showed that foliar herbivore damage resulted in shorter styles and lower nectar volumes. This reduction in style length could reduce pollen deposition between different floral morphs that is required for optimal pollination in a distylous plant. We did not detect any differences in the volatile blends released by damaged and undamaged branches, suggesting that foliar herbivore-induced changes in floral morphology and rewards, and not volatile blends, are the primary mechanism mediating changes in visitation. Our results provide novel mechanisms for how plant responses induced by foliar herbivores can lead to ecological costs.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Plants interact simultaneously with diverse communities of antagonistic and mutualistic organisms. Although these interactions are often studied in isolation, plant traits that influence multiple interactions are common, and thus plant responses to one organism can mediate interactions with multiple other organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188408.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188408.ref002">2</xref>]. For example, herbivore damage can induce complex changes in plant primary and secondary metabolism that reduce subsequent herbivore damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188408.ref003">3</xref>], but these changes can also negatively affect interactions with mutualists, including pollinators, seed dispersers, and mycorrhizal fungi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188408.ref004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188408.ref006">6</xref>]. The negative effects of induced plant defenses on mutualistic interactions are examples of ‘ecological costs of defense’, which are costs that arise when the expression of defense traits alters interactions between plants and their environment in a way that reduces plant fitness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188408.ref007">7</xref>]. Ecological costs can occur due to a variety of different mechanisms and may be even more important than physiological costs in determining the overall fitness consequences of defense responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188408.ref008">8</xref>]. Here we focus on costs of foliar herbivory that can result from a reduction in the visitation of pollinators.</p>
<p>A growing body of literature has documented an effect of herbivory on plant-pollinator interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188408.ref009">9</xref>]. Altered plant-pollinator interactions can lead to ecological costs when herbivory alters floral traits in a way that either reduces pollinator preference or the efficiency of pollen transfer and ultimately plant fitness. There are now several examples of insect pollinators, including bees and syrphid flies, that avoid flowers on plants that are damaged by herbivores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188408.ref010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188408.ref012">12</xref>]. However, there are also examples of plants that become more attractive to pollinators after induction by root herbivores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188408.ref013">13</xref>]. The effects of herbivory on vertebrate pollinators are less well-documented, but at least one study found a reduction in hummingbird visitation to flowers following experimental defoliation treatments in a tropical herb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188408.ref014">14</xref>]. In addition to effects on pollinator preference, a few studies have also suggested that herbivory can reduce the efficiency of pollen transfer, either through changes in the duration of visits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188408.ref010">10</xref>] or changes in floral morphology that reduce the probability that pollinators will contact the sexual organs of the flower effectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188408.ref015">15</xref>]. However, we still have only a limited knowledge of the variety of mechanisms through which plant responses to herbivore damage may influence pollination success.</p>
<p>Induced responses to herbivory could be affecting floral traits and pollination through at least three different mechanisms. First, foliar herbivory can reduce the resources available for floral structures or rewards. This may occur because photosynthetic capacity is reduced when leaf tissue is lost or because an increased proportion of available resources are allocated to defense-related processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188408.ref016">16</xref>]. The result can be altered flowering phenology, reduced flower number, decreased flower size, or reduced quality and quantity of floral rewards, and any of these changes could make flowers less attractive to pollinators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188408.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188408.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188408.ref016">16</xref>]. Furthermore, many of these changes in floral traits could reduce pollinator efficiency. For example, changes in corolla tube size and morphology are known to influence whether pollinators make effective contact with sexual parts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188408.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188408.ref018">18</xref>]. A second mechanism through which foliar herbivory can affect pollination is by inducing the production of deterrent or toxic secondary metabolites, which can be expressed in nectar or pollen and alter pollinator behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188408.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188408.ref019">19</xref>]. For example, herbivory has been shown to increase the concentration of toxic alkaloids in nectar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188408.ref001">1</xref>] and this increase in alkaloids negatively affects male plant reproduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188408.ref019">19</xref>]. However, evidence has also shown that an increase in alkaloids can be beneficial for the plant by increasing the number of visitors per nectar volume [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188408.ref020">20</xref>]. A third mechanism through which herbivory can influence pollination is through changes in the volatile profiles of flowers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188408.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188408.ref021">21</xref>]. Changes in plant volatile production following herbivory are common and can provide important benefits to the plant by deterring subsequent herbivores or attracting natural enemies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188408.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188408.ref023">23</xref>], but altered volatile profiles can also disrupt pollinator attraction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188408.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188408.ref021">21</xref>]. Although the importance of floral volatile cues has primarily been studied for insect pollinators, some evidence suggests that certain floral volatiles can also alter hummingbird behavior, either increasing or decreasing time of visitation depending on the compounds involved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188408.ref020">20</xref>].</p>
<p>This study investigates the consequences of foliar herbivory in a hummingbird-pollinated tropical distylous plant: <italic>Palicourea angustifolia</italic> Kunth (Rubiaceae). We hypothesized that foliar herbivory reduces plant fitness by altering plant traits that are essential in pollinator attraction and reward. Very little is known about the natural history of this species, so we first conducted an experiment to describe its pollination requirements at the study site, providing essential background for understanding potential ecological costs. Our primary objective was to determine whether damage from foliar herbivores leads to a reduction in fruit set. After finding this effect we conducted a follow up experiment to assess whether damage from leaf herbivores influences floral visitation by different classes of hummingbird and insect pollinators. Finally, to had better understand the potential mechanisms that could be driving the pollinator-mediated effects of leaf herbivory on fruit set, we hypothesized that herbivory could influence a) floral morphology, b) nectar volume and nectar concentration, and/or c) volatile organic compounds (VOCs) could explain the found patterns.</p>

<title>Study site and system</title>
<p>The study was conducted in an Andean forest relict located at 2200 meters in the municipality of El Rosal (Cundinamarca), near the village La Hondura, Colombia between August 18, 2012 and January 24, 2014. The average annual temperature is 14°C, average relative humidity is 85%, and average precipitation is 1410mm. Our study plant, <italic>P</italic>. <italic>angustifolia</italic>, is a common understory shrub of 1.5 to 3.5 m height that is widely distributed between 500-3350m [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188408.ref024">24</xref>]. The inflorescences are terminal panicles with 40 to 160 pink flowers (Chautá pers. obs.). The flowers in the genus <italic>Palicourea</italic> have well developed tubes, and are assumed to be pollinated primarily by hummingbirds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188408.ref025">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188408.ref027">27</xref>]. Flowers are distylous—approximately 47% of plants are pin morphs with long styles and short stamens and 53% are thrum morphs with short styles and long stamens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188408.g001">Fig 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0188408.s001">S1 File</xref>). This is a common polymorphism that has evolved repeatedly in at least 25 angiosperm families and is often associated with reproductive incompatibility among individuals of the same morph [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188408.ref028">28</xref>]. Nectar volume and nectar concentrations do not differ between the two morphs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0188408.s001">S1 File</xref>), and both morphs are commonly visited by both hummingbirds and insects (primarily bees, but also wasps and butterflies; Chautá pers. obs.).</p>

<p>For all experiments, the generalist grasshopper <italic>Zeromastax selenesii</italic> (Orthoptera: Eumastacidae, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188408.g001">Fig 1B</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188408.ref029">29</xref>] was used as an herbivore, since it was the main foliar herbivore that we found feeding on <italic>P</italic>. <italic>angustifolia</italic> in the study region. These grasshoppers will consume both leaves and flowers of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>angustifolia</italic>, but floral herbivory was prevented in all experiments (see below). For all experiments, we collected adult <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>selenesii</italic> in the field from <italic>P</italic>. <italic>angustifolia</italic> and other plants on the same day that we began the experiments. Although both adult and juvenile grasshoppers feed on <italic>P</italic>. <italic>angustifolia</italic> we used only adults in the experiments to minimize variation in consumption rates among individuals.</p>

<title>Pollination requirements</title>
<p>In order to understand the potential for ecological costs mediated by pollination in this system, we first conducted an experiment to determine the dependence of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>angustifolia</italic> on pollinators to successfully set fruit. We chose plants from both pin morphs (N = 15 plants) and thrum morphs (N = 17 plants) for a pollination experiment that assessed whether plants can produce fruits asexually and whether there are differences in fruit production between homomorphic and heteromorphic crosses. On each plant, branches with buds and no open flowers were covered with 'Breather Sleeves' (Palm Tree Packaging, Inc, Florida, USA) to exclude natural visitation from pollinators. When flowers opened, we chose five flowers from each inflorescence and applied one of each of the following five treatments: 1) Manual homomorphic outcrossing (thrum x thrum and pin x pin); 2) Manual heteromorphic outcrossing (thrum x pin and pin x thrum); 3) Manual self-pollination where pollen from the same flower was transferred from the anthers to the stigma; 4) Spontaneous self-pollination where the flowers were bagged during anthesis; and 5) Parthenocarpy test where anthers were removed when the flowers opened. After applying the treatments, the inflorescences were re-bagged to prevent natural visitation and pollen transfer. We monitored development on all inflorescences and recorded whether each flower successfully developed into a fruit.</p>

<title>Effect of herbivory on fruit set</title>
<p>To determine the effects of herbivory on fruit set, we experimentally manipulated damage 39 plants, each of which was paired with an undamaged control. Pairs of plants were always chosen that were located within two meters of one another to allow for simultaneous observations of pollinators (see below). In some cases, in order to allow for the maximum number of plant pairs located in close proximity to one another, pairs of plants were selected where the two individuals were of different morphs; however, preliminary data showed no differences in visitation rates between pin and thrum plants and we varied the identity of the control plants (pin or thrum) among pairs to avoid any potential bias (t-test = 1.08, p = 0.28). On one plant in each pair we selected and bagged two branches with inflorescences at the bud stage that were at approximately the same size, phenological stage, and height on the plant. One of the branches received herbivore damage where one individual adult of <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>selenesii</italic> was placed inside the bag for three days to consume the leaves. This branch was used to measure locally-induced responses to herbivory. The second branch on the same shrub was bagged in the same manner but received no damage and was used to measure systemically-induced responses to herbivory. In order to prevent the grasshopper from eating the inflorescence, the inflorescence was covered with a second bag during the three days the herbivore was feeding. Damage to leaves varied from approximately 4–49% tissue removed. In rare cases where the grasshoppers died during the three-day damage treatment, plants were excluded from the analysis. The second plant in each pair served as an absolute control in which a single branch that was approximately the same size and height was bagged in the same way without placing any herbivore on the plant. After the three-day herbivore treatments, we removed the grasshoppers and the bags from all branches and allowed natural pollinator visitation to the inflorescences. We counted the total number of flowers that were aborted and the number that successfully set fruit.</p>

<title>Effects of herbivory on floral visitors</title>
<p>To determine if foliar herbivory affected pollinator visitation, we monitored pollinator visits to 26 pairs of plants from the experiment described above. The locally-induced, systemically induced, and control branches from a single plant pair were then observed simultaneously by one observer to record the identity of the floral visitors (hummingbirds, bees, wasp and butterflies) and the number of flowers visited by each individual visitor during a period of 30 minutes. When pollinator abundance was low or when very few flowers were available on experimental branches, the observations were repeated one or two times on different days to increase the accuracy of the recorded effect. All observations were conducted between October 12, 2013 and 24 January 24, 2014 during sunny or partially overcast weather from 8h to 15h. Just prior to each observation, we counted the number of open flowers on each inflorescence from each of the three branches. Birds were identified to species directly in the field based on the Hilty and Brown bird field guide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188408.ref030">30</xref>] and insect visitors were collected and identified to species or genus in the lab with help of bee specialist Diana Obregon.</p>

<title>Effects of herbivory on floral morphology and nectar rewards</title>
<p>To establish if foliar herbivory causes changes in floral morphology and rewards that could alter floral visitation, we selected another 30 pairs of plants (15 pin and 15 thrum) of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>angustifolia</italic>. On each pair, we selected branches with inflorescences at the bud stage to serve as locally-induced, systemically-induced, and control branches and applied grasshopper herbivory treatments as described above. After 3 days, grasshoppers and bags were removed and once the flowers opened we took measurements of corolla length, anther length, style length, and distance from anthers to stigma for one flower randomly chosen from each inflorescence. From a subset of the same inflorescences (5 pin and 6 thrum), we also collected nectar on one randomly chosen flower. Nectar volume was measured using 2μL microcapillary pipettes (Drummond Scientific Company, Broomall, PA). The nectar concentration was estimated using a handheld refractometer (Reichert Digital Brix/RI-Chek). Due to low nectar volumes, all samples were diluted in 0.1 mL distilled water prior to taking nectar concentration measurements. The nectar concentration of the floral nectar was then calculated as the measured solution concentration multiplied by the ratio of the final solution volume to the collected nectar volume.</p>

<title>Effects of herbivory on volatile emissions of flowers and leaves</title>
<p>To establish if foliar herbivory causes changes in volatile emissions that could alter visitation, we chose ten pairs of plants and applied the treatments of local induction, systemic induction and control as described above. After removing the grasshoppers, we collected volatiles following the headspace method by Kessler and Halitschke (2009) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188408.ref021">21</xref>] by enclosing single leaves and inflorescences of each branch in 500 mL polyethylene cups fitted with ORBO-32 charcoal adsorbent tubes (Supelco, Bellefonte, PA, USA). Air was pulled through the cup at a flow rate of approximately 250 mL/min for 8 hours using a 12 V vacuum pump (GAST®, Gast Manufacturing Inc., BentonHarbor, MI, USA). Tubes were then capped and kept frozen prior to analysis. Prior to elution, we added tetraline (450 ng) dissolved in toluene (5 μL) as an internal standard to each tube. The tubes were then desorbed with dichloromethane (350 μL) and samples were analyzed by GC-MS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188408.ref031">31</xref>]. We used a Varian CP-3800 GC coupled with a Saturn 2200 MS and fit with a DB-WAX column programmed as follows: injector at 225°C, temperature initial in the column at 45°C for 6 min, increased at 10°C min−1 to 130°C, increased at 5°C min−1 to 180°C, increased at 20°C min−1 to 230°C, held for 5 min, increased at 20°C min−1 to 250°C, and held for 5 min. Helium carrier gas flow was set to 1 ml min−1 with an electronic pressure control unit. Spectra were collected at −70 eV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188408.ref031">31</xref>].

The response variable was the binomial count of the number of flowers that developed into fruits and the number that were aborted. Treatment was included as a fixed effect, and the plant pair was included as a random effect.

<title>Effects of herbivory on floral visitors</title>
<p>To assess the effects of herbivory on pollinator visitation, we first compared total number of visits and the total number of visitors among the three treatments using two separate generalized linear mixed models (glmms) with poisson distributions. The response variables were the total number of visits or visitors summed across all observation periods for each replicate plant pair. Treatment, the number of open flowers, and their interaction were included as fixed effects and plant pair was included as a random effect for both analyses. Next, to further examine the effect of herbivory on individual pollinator species, we summed the total number of visits from each visitor species for each treatment and used a chi-square test of independence to determine whether the frequency distribution of visits among locally-induced, systemically-induced, and control inflorescences differed among the different species of pollinators visiting <italic>P</italic>. <italic>angustifolia</italic>. Based on a lack of independence between treatment and pollinator identity (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec015">results</xref>), we analyzed the effect of treatment separately for individual pollinator species. These analyses were only conducted for pollinator species that visited inflorescences in at least five replicate plant pairs. These included just two hummingbird species (<italic>Ocreatus underwoodii</italic> and <italic>Colibri coruscans</italic>), and two bee species (<italic>Trigona fulviventris</italic> and <italic>Paratrigona</italic> sp.). Prior to analysis, we eliminated data from all replicate pairs in which the pollinator species being analyzed did not visit any of the three inflorescences. The total number of visits by the pollinator species being analyzed was summed by replicate pair (total from all observation periods) and we analyzed the effects of treatment on the number of visits using a generalized linear mixed model (glmm) with a poisson distribution. We also included the number of open flowers on the inflorescence (averaging across all observation periods) as a covariate. Due to limited sample sizes in these analyses, we did not include the interaction term between treatment and the number of open flowers. Plant pair was included as a random effect in all analyses. When significant effects of treatment were detected, the glmms were followed by a Tukey multiple comparisons test to determine pairwise differences among treatments.</p>

<p>To assess differences in floral morphology and rewards, we used linear mixed models with treatment, floral morph (pin or thrum), and the interaction between treatment and morph as fixed effects and the replicate plant pair as a random effect. These were conducted separately for the following response variables: corolla length, anther length, style length, anther/stigma distance, nectar volume, and nectar concentration. Nectar concentration data was log-transformed prior to analysis to fit assumptions of normality.

<title>Effects of herbivory on volatile emissions of flowers and leaves</title>
<p>To examine differences in volatile blends among treatments, we used a random forest (RF) between-group classification algorithm as described in Ranganathan and Borges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188408.ref036">36</xref>]. This analysis provides several valuable results for understanding differences in complex traits such as volatile blends, including: 1) a proximity matrix of individual samples that can be visualized using a multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) plot, 2) a ranking of the relative importance of different predictor variables (here the individual compounds) in distinguishing among treatment groups, 3) a measure of the prediction accuracy with which unknown samples can be correctly classified into groups using the predictor variables. Tentative identification of the peaks was made using the NIST mass spectrum data base (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0188408.s003">S2 Table</xref>). We conducted the RF analysis in several stages using the packages randomForest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188408.ref037">37</xref>] and varSelRF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188408.ref038">38</xref>] in R version 3.1.2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188408.ref033">33</xref>]. First, we conducted an RF classification analysis for all six groups (locally-induced, systemically-induced, and control for both leaves and flowers) and visually examined whether there were differences among these groups using an MDS plot. Based on these results, we conducted further analyses to compare the volatile emission of leaves and flowers, the volatile emission among treatments just for leaves and the volatile emission among treatments just for flowers. We used 200 bootstrap iterations of each analysis to select compounds that best distinguished among groups. Compounds that were selected in greater than 20% of bootstrapped models were retained for use in MANOVAs comparing the concentrations of the selected compounds among groups. Where significant overall differences among groups were detected, we followed the MANOVAs with ANOVAs comparing the concentrations of individual compounds among groups.</p>

Corolla length and anther length were not affected by herbivory or by the interaction between herbivory and morph but were different between morphs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0188408.t003">Table 3</xref>).</p>

<title>Effects of foliar herbivory on volatile emissions of flowers and leaves</title>
<p>Overall volatile emission profiles were clearly different between leaves and flowers, but there were no clear effects of foliar herbivory treatment (based on visual inspection of the random forest MDS plot; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188408.g007">Fig 7</xref>). The RF classification model comparing leaves and flowers had a bootstrap estimate of prediction error of 0.23 and revealed five major compounds that were important in distinguishing the two groups.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Plant responses induced by herbivore damage are a defense mechanism that can protect plants against further damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188408.ref039">39</xref>]. However, induced responses have also been shown to be ecologically costly in that they can reduce visits by pollinators and cause a reduction in seed set [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188408.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188408.ref008">8</xref>]. Here we contribute to this body of work by showing that herbivore-induced responses in a distylous tropical shrub can reduce seed set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188408.g002">Fig 2</xref>) and affect hummingbird as well as insect visitation to flowers (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188408.g003">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188408.g004">4</xref>), particularly those flowers that are directly adjacent to damaged leaves. We examined multiple mechanisms through which herbivore damage may be influencing the preferences and efficiency of pollinators and found that induced responses in plants can lead to several changes in floral rewards and morphology. We detected a localized decrease in nectar volume and increase in nectar concentration following damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188408.g006">Fig 6</xref>), which may have contributed to the observed reduction in pollinator preference that we found in at least two hummingbirdsd and two bee species. We also detected a localized decrease in style length in both pin and thrum floral morphs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188408.g005">Fig 5</xref>), which may decrease pollination efficiency in a distylous plant where cross-pollination between morphs depends on precise placement of pollen on pollinator body surfaces and a morphological match between the styles and the anthers of the opposite morphs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188408.ref028">28</xref>].</p>
<p>Our experiments on pollination mechanisms showed that <italic>P</italic>. <italic>angustifolia</italic> is an obligate outcrosser and requires animal pollination for reproduction (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0188408.t001">Table 1</xref>). Distylous plants often exhibit complete heteromorphic incompatibility, where only legitimate visits between different morphs result in pollination and fruit set [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188408.ref040">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188408.ref042">42</xref>]. In our system there is still partial compatibility among flowers from different individuals of the same morph, as has been reported for other species of <italic>Palicourea</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188408.ref043">43</xref>]. However, pollination was approximately four-fold more effective when pollen was moved between different morphs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0188408.t001">Table 1</xref>). This reciprocal cross-pollination may be achieved primarily by hummingbirds in <italic>Palicourea</italic>, since pollen can be deposited precisely along hummingbird bills as they probe flowers for nectar and efficiently transferred to the stigma of the opposite morph [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188408.ref043">43</xref>]. Hummingbirds also visit numerous flowers in each foraging bout [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188408.ref043">43</xref>], whereas the main bee species we observed, <italic>T</italic>. <italic>fulviventris</italic>, rarely moves among individual plants and can sometimes act as a pollen and nectar thief rather than a legitimate pollinator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188408.ref043">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188408.ref044">44</xref>]. Our data also suggest that fruit set in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>angustifolia</italic> is pollen limited; open-pollinated control plants in our study produced an average fruit set of only 45% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188408.g003">Fig 3</xref>), compared to an average fruit set of 88% across all intermorph crosses in our hand-pollinated plants (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0188408.t001">Table 1</xref>). Together, these results suggest that any reduction in pollinator visitation, particularly from hummingbirds, that occurs because of induced responses to herbivory is likely to have an important impact on the reproductive success of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>angustifolia</italic>.</p>
<p>Our results clearly showed that branches subjected to leaf herbivory produced a proportionally lower number of fruits relative to undamaged controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188408.g002">Fig 2</xref>). The effects on locally-induced inflorescences were the strongest (a 68% reduction relative to controls), but there were also strong effects on systemically-induced inflorescences (a 29% reduction relative to controls). These results are in agreement with past work showing a negative relationship between leaf herbivory and fruit set in other species of Rubiaceae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188408.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188408.ref043">43</xref>]. The negative effects of herbivory on fruit set may be due to a combination of physiological costs, which arise due to a direct reduction in resources available for fruit production following herbivore damage, and ecological costs, which arise due to altered interactions with the plant’s environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188408.ref008">8</xref>]. Both types of costs are commonly reported, but are often interdependent and difficult to disentangle experimentally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188408.ref008">8</xref>]. Our results suggest that physiological costs of herbivory, manifested as changes in floral morphology and nectar rewards, can lead to ecological costs in terms of reduced visitation or efficiency, magnifying any negative effects on plant fitness that may occur due to reduced resource allocation to fruit development.</p>
<p>Results from our floral visitation experiments (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188408.g003">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188408.g004">4</xref>) show that hummingbirds as well as insect floral visitors can identify and discriminate against inflorescences on previously damaged branches. Visitation was reduced most strongly in locally-induced branches (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188408.g003">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188408.g004">4</xref>), which indicates that at least some of the chemical or physical changes in floral traits following damage are fairly localized on the plant. All the pollinator species that we could examine statistically were negatively affected by the induction treatments; however, different pollinator species did vary in the strength of their responses and in the relative deterrence of locally and systemically-induced flowers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0188408.s002">S1 Table</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188408.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Furthermore, trends in the pollinator species that we did not analyze statistically due to very low visitation rates were quite variable; in some cases, (e.g. <italic>Colibri thalassinus</italic>) visitation was even higher on induced branches than on controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0188408.s002">S1 Table</xref>). This variation could be due in part to differences among pollinator species in the complex combinations of visual, olfactory, or gustatory cues that they use to discriminate among flowers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188408.ref045">45</xref>].</p>
<p>Changes in nectar volume and concentration were most likely to explain the observed changes in pollinator preference. Nectar volume has been shown to be a particularly important trait for determining hummingbird feeding preferences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188408.ref046">46</xref>], and the pattern of nectar volumes among treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188408.g004">Fig 4</xref>) does concur with the pattern of hummingbird preferences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188408.g003">Fig 3</xref>). However, hummingbirds also prefer higher nectar concentrations within the range of concentrations typical in nectars [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188408.ref047">47</xref>], and it is unclear in our study why nectar concentration increased following herbivory and how it may have influenced hummingbird preferences. Herbivory has been shown to cause localized water stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188408.ref048">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188408.ref049">49</xref>], and one hypothesis is that herbivory reduced the quantity of water available for nectar production, reducing nectar volume and increasing its concentration as we observed in our study. There are also several other traits that may have influenced hummingbird and insect preferences that were not quantified in this study. To our knowledge, <italic>P</italic>. <italic>angustifolia</italic> has not previously been investigated phytochemically, but related species contain a diversity of potentially toxic secondary metabolites, including alkaloids and iridoid glycosides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188408.ref050">50</xref>], and these classes of compounds can occur in nectar or pollen and may be induced in response to damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188408.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188408.ref051">51</xref>]. Further research, including chemical analyses and behavioral experiments with key pollinator species, would be necessary to fully understand how the complex changes in floral traits following damage may influence pollinator preference.</p>
<p>Another important mechanism through which herbivory may influence pollination success is by altering floral morphology in a way that affects the efficiency of pollen transfer. Our results showed that herbivory can cause a reduction in style length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188408.g005">Fig 5</xref>), similar to results from previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188408.ref021">21</xref>]. This effect has previously been interpreted as a means to decrease anther-stigma separation and allow more self-pollination in herbivore-damaged plants that are less likely to be visited by pollinators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188408.ref021">21</xref>]. However, the adaptive function of this proposed mechanism depends on flowers that are homomorphic and self-compatible. The consequences of reduced style length in an obligate outcrossing distylous plant such as <italic>P</italic>. <italic>angustifolia</italic> are quite different. Shorter styles would result in reduced anther-stigma distance in pin morphs and increased anther-stigma distance in thrum morphs, but this change would have limited effects on fertilization and reproductive output in a self-incompatible plant. More importantly, a change in style length would lead to a mis-match in lengths between styles and the anthers of the opposite morphs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188408.g005">Fig 5</xref>), thereby breaking down the reciprocal pollen transfer mechanism that is thought to be the primary evolutionary advantage of distyly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188408.ref028">28</xref>]. Thus, in the case of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>angustifolia</italic> and other distylous plants, any reduction in style length very likely represents an ecological cost of defense.</p>
<p>Although previous reports have shown significant differences in the volatile profiles of flowers and leaves before and after herbivory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188408.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188408.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188408.ref023">23</xref>], we did not detect such differences in the volatile profiles of leaves or flowers of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>angustifolia</italic>. However, we did clearly detect different compounds in the leaves and flowers of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>angustifolia</italic>, refuting the misconception that flowers of ornithophilous plants produce no or very low quantities of volatiles that are not detectable by GCMS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188408.ref052">52</xref>]. There are two ways in which we could interpret our results. One is that the reduction in flower visitation is not dictated by a change in the volatile profile of the plant after herbivory. The other explanation is that the volatiles that mediate the interaction between <italic>Palicourea</italic> and its pollinators are present in minor quantities that we were not able to detect with our methodology.</p>
<p>Overall, this study showed that foliar herbivory can alter interactions with hummingbird and insect pollinators and lead to ecological costs of defense in a tropical distylous plant. Changes in hummingbird and insect visitation following herbivory were likely mediated by a combination of changes in floral traits, including changes in flower morphology and changes in nectar volume and nectar concentration. These results emphasize the potential for complex interactions between plant antagonists and mutualists and the importance of studying these interactions simultaneously to gain a complete picture of the costs and benefits of plant responses to herbivory.</p>
