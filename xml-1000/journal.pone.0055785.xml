      <abstract>
        <p>Mitochondrial calcium uptake is present in nearly all vertebrate tissues and is believed to be critical in shaping calcium signaling, regulating ATP synthesis and controlling cell death. Calcium uptake occurs through a channel called the uniporter that resides in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Recently, we used comparative genomics to identify MICU1 and MCU as the key regulatory and putative pore-forming subunits of this channel, respectively. Using bioinformatics, we now report that the human genome encodes two additional paralogs of MICU1, which we call MICU2 and MICU3, each of which likely arose by gene duplication and exhibits distinct patterns of organ expression. We demonstrate that MICU1 and MICU2 are expressed in HeLa and HEK293T cells, and provide multiple lines of biochemical evidence that MCU, MICU1 and MICU2 reside within a complex and cross-stabilize each other's protein expression in a cell-type dependent manner. Using <italic>in vivo</italic> RNAi technology to silence MICU1, MICU2 or both proteins in mouse liver, we observe an additive impairment in calcium handling without adversely impacting mitochondrial respiration or membrane potential. The results identify MICU2 as a new component of the uniporter complex that may contribute to the tissue-specific regulation of this channel.</p>

      <p>The ability of mitochondria to transport calcium is thought to be fundamental for the regulation of cellular bioenergetics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055785-Denton1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055785-Hajnoczky1">[2]</xref> and cell death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055785-Szalai1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055785-Scorrano1">[4]</xref>. Mitochondrial calcium uptake and buffering enable these organelles to shape cytosolic calcium transients, resulting in mitochondrial control over key biological processes, including neurotransmission and hormone secretion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055785-Jouaville1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055785-Kaftan1">[6]</xref>. The primary route of calcium uptake is via a low affinity calcium “uniporter” located in the inner mitochondrial membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055785-Deluca1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055785-Vasington1">[8]</xref>. This channel mechanism, defined by its dependence on mitochondrial membrane potential, sensitivity to Ru-360 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055785-Vasington2">[9]</xref> and activation at micromolar calcium concentrations, was first characterized in isolated mitochondria in 1961 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055785-Deluca1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055785-Vasington1">[8]</xref>. In subsequent decades, the biophysical properties of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter were extensively characterized <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055785-Carafoli1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055785-Kirichok1">[11]</xref>, but its molecular identity remained elusive.</p>
      <p>Recently, we coupled observations from comparative physiology with integrative genomics to identify two proteins required for normal mitochondrial calcium handling: MICU1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055785-Perocchi1">[12]</xref> and MCU <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055785-Baughman1">[13]</xref>. Based on sequence analysis and functional studies, we hypothesized that MCU is the channel-forming subunit of the uniporter, whereas MICU1 fulfilled important criteria for a regulatory protein.

        <title>MICU1, MICU2 and MICU3 form a family of paralogous genes</title>
        <p>We previously used comparative genomics to identify MICU1, a mitochondrial protein essential for mitochondrial calcium handling in HeLa cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055785-Perocchi1">[12]</xref>. MICU1 (previously known as CBARA1 or EFHA3) has a mitochondrial targeting sequence as well as two evolutionarily conserved EF hands. Sequence analysis reveals that MICU1 shares approximately 25% sequence identity with two human genes, <italic>EFHA1</italic> and <italic>EFHA2</italic>, which have not been studied before. These three proteins are conserved in vertebrates, whereas only one homolog is present in plants and protozoa.</p>
        <p>To elucidate the evolutionary relationship of these three proteins, we performed a multiple sequence alignment using homologs from vertebrates, plants and protozoa. This analysis placed the protozoa and plant homologs as outgroups on a phylogenetic tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055785-g001">Fig. 1a</xref>), indicating that EFHA1 and EFHA2 are vertebrate paralogs of MICU1 that likely arose from a gene duplication event prior to vertebrate evolution. We now re-name EFHA1 as MICU2 and EFHA2 as MICU3.</p>

        <p>Like MICU1, MICU2 and MICU3 have N-terminal targeting sequences consistent with mitochondrial localization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055785-Emanuelsson1">[28]</xref>. In our previous proteomic studies, MICU2 and MICU3 were detected in mitochondria from various mouse tissues, although their expression patterns differed significantly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055785-Pagliarini1">[18]</xref>. MICU1 was broadly expressed and detected in 12 out of 14 mouse tissues, whereas MICU2 was detected in 7 out of 14 tissues with strong expression in visceral organs. In contrast, MICU3 was found in 6 out of 14 tissues with a strong signature in skeletal muscle and the central nervous system. Despite being detected in multiple mouse tissues, MICU3 lacked other evidence of being mitochondrial, scoring just below the stringent threshold required to be a part of the MitoCarta collection. This is in contrast to MICU2, which was reported in MitoCarta and localized to the mitochondria using high-content microscopy to visualize its subcellular localization.</p>
        <p>Analysis of published microarrays of MICU1-3 across 21 different mouse tissues revealed a similar expression pattern as predicted by MitoCarta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055785-g001">Fig. 1b</xref>). MICU2 was strongly expressed in visceral organs whereas MICU3 was expressed almost exclusively in neural tissues and skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055785-g001">Fig. 1b</xref>). In the present study, we focus on MICU2 due to greater expression in visceral organs in which we can apply <italic>in vivo</italic> siRNA technology to achieve silencing.</p>
        <p>Sequence comparison of human MICU1 and MICU2 reveals highly conserved domain architecture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055785-g001">Fig. 1c</xref>). Similar to MICU1, MICU2 has two EF-hands separated by a long stretch of residues predicted to form α-helices. In previous work, we showed that the calcium-coordinating residues in the EF-hands of MICU1 are highly conserved across species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055785-Perocchi1">[12]</xref>. Likewise, MICU2 demonstrates perfect conservation in the acidic residues that cap the EF-hands across evolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055785-g001">Fig. 1c</xref>).</p>

        <title>MICU1 and MICU2 stabilize each other's protein expression</title>
        <p>In previous studies, we demonstrated that MICU1 regulates mitochondrial calcium handling in HeLa cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055785-Perocchi1">[12]</xref>. Since MICU1 and MICU2 are paralogs with conserved domain architecture, it is possible that they have redundant roles and are expressed in a mutually exclusive manner across different cell types. To address this possibility, we blotted whole cell lysate from HEK293T and HeLa cells for MICS1U1 and MICU2, which revealed expression of both proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055785-g002">Fig. 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0055785.s001">S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0055785.s002">S2a</xref>). Interestingly, in the setting of MICU1 knockdown, there was a significant reduction in MICU2 protein expression in both HEK293T and HeLa cells despite preserved MICU2 RNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055785-g002">Fig. 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0055785.s002">S2a</xref>). This phenomenon was observed following treatment with multiple hairpins (shMICU1<sub>a</sub> and shMICU1<sub>b</sub>), indicating that this result is a biological consequence of MICU1 loss rather than an off target effect. Conversely, overexpression of MICU1 in HEK293T resulted in higher levels of MICU2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055785-g002">Fig. 2b</xref>). Interestingly, in the setting of MICU2 knockdown, a reduction of MICU1 was observed in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0055785.s002">Fig. S2a</xref>) whereas no effect on MICU1 expression was observed in HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055785-g002">Fig. 2a</xref>). This discrepancy may reflect additional mechanisms contributing to MICU1 stability in HEK293T cells. Collectively, these studies demonstrate that MICU1 and MICU2 are expressed in multiple cell types and that their protein expression is contingent on one another.</p>

        <p>In our previous studies, we demonstrated that MICU1 and MCU physically interact either directly or indirectly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055785-Baughman1">[13]</xref>. To determine whether MICU2 physically interacts with these proteins, we performed immunoprecipitation on cells stably expressing either MCU-FLAG or GFP-FLAG. Although endogenous MICU1 and MICU2 were present in cell lysate from both cell lines, immunoprecipitation with an anti-FLAG antibody specifically recovered MICU1 and MICU2 from the MCU-FLAG cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055785-g002">Fig. 2c</xref>). It is notable that the heterologous expression of MCU-FLAG resulted in increased protein expression of both MICU1 and MICU2 as seen in the whole cell lysate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055785-g002">Fig. 2c</xref>), suggesting that MCU overexpression stabilizes the protein expression of MICU1 and MICU2. In addition, immunoprecipitation performed on cells stably expressing either MICU1-FLAG or GFP-FLAG demonstrated specific recovery of MICU2 with MICU1 in the presence of excess calcium or EGTA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055785-g002">Fig. 2d</xref>).

In mitochondria isolated from all treatment groups, membrane potential was responsive to ADP and fully depolarized by the uncoupler carbonyl cyanide <italic>m</italic>-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), indicating that silencing MICU1 or MICU2 did not abolish the mitochondrial membrane potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055785-g003">Fig. 3d</xref>). It is notable that these findings are similar to what we previously reported for <italic>in vivo</italic> silencing of MCU in mouse liver <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055785-Baughman1">[13]</xref>.</p>

        <p>Next, we analyzed calcium uptake kinetics in mitochondria isolated from control and knockdown mice. We added a single, large 50 µM spike of calcium to mitochondria suspended in buffer containing extramitochondrial Calcium Green-5N (CG5N) and observed the rate of calcium clearance by measuring CG5N fluorescence. Mitochondria from siMICU1 and siMICU2 mice demonstrated moderately impaired calcium uptake kinetics whereas mitochondria from siMICU1+siMICU2 mice demonstrated an additive defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055785-g004">Fig. 4a</xref>). This result was also observed when multiple spikes of calcium were added to mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055785-g004">Fig. 4b</xref>). Interestingly, knockdown mitochondria were unable to fully buffer a second pulse of calcium, whereas control mitochondria rapidly buffered the entire pulse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055785-g004">Fig. 4b</xref>). Knockdown mitochondria demonstrated premature release of calcium, suggesting that knockdown mitochondria were sensitized to release calcium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055785-g004">Fig. 4b</xref>). In addition, MCU protein expression was significantly decreased in knockdown mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055785-g004">Fig. 4c</xref>). The degree of MCU protein loss correlated with the phenotype strength, raising the question of whether MCU loss was responsible for at least part of the observed phenotype. Similar to the effect of MICU2 knockdown in HeLa cells, loss of MICU2 in mouse liver resulted in decreased expression of MICU1 to about half of wild-type levels (densitometry not shown). By extending the phenomenon of cross-stabilization to mouse tissues, this result strongly suggests that a fundamental role of these paralogs is stabilizing each other's protein expression.</p>

        <title><italic>In vivo</italic> silencing of MICU1 and MICU2 alters MCU complex size</title>
        <p>In previous studies, we demonstrated that MCU is present in a complex of approximately 480 kDa using blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE) and western blot (WB) analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055785-Baughman1">[13]</xref>. To gain insight into how silencing these proteins may affect the uniporter complex, we solubilized control and knockdown mitochondria in digitonin and performed BN-PAGE and western blot analysis, which revealed decreased levels of MCU complex in knockdown mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055785-g004">Fig. 4d</xref>). In addition, blotting with anti-MCU revealed a shift in MCU complex size in knockdown mitochondria relative to siLUC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055785-g004">Fig. 4d</xref>). The percentage of shifted MCU complex was greater in si-MICU1 mitochondria compared to si-MICU2 mitochondria. The basis for this difference is unclear, but it may reflect less efficient MICU2 knockdown or increased sensitivity of the uniporter complex to MICU1 loss relative to MICU2 loss. Interestingly, the degree of shift correlated with the severity of calcium uptake. This result was also observed in human cell lines stably expressing shMICU1<sub>a</sub> and shLZ (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0055785.s002">Fig. S2b</xref>). The shift in the MCU complex size could be rescued by introducing a cDNA encoding MICU1 that was resistant to shRNA degradation, suggesting that this shift was specific to MICU1 knockdown rather than an off-target effect (data not shown).</p>

        <title>Redundant or complementary roles of MICU1 and MICU2?</title>
        <p>An important question is whether MICU1 and MICU2 have redundant or complementary roles in mitochondrial calcium uptake. The fact that MICU1 and MICU2 are both expressed in multiple human cell lines and mouse liver and that simultaneous silencing results in an additive calcium handling defect suggests that they contribute independently to mitochondrial calcium handling. However, the finding that their loss produces similar defects, including reduced calcium uptake kinetics, premature calcium release and a shift in the MCU complex size, indicates that they may have overlapping molecular roles in mitochondrial calcium handling.</p>
        <p>To explore this question, we used a commercially available mt-AeQ HeLa reporter cell line that reports matrix free calcium. In this background, we stably expressed a shRNA targeting MICU1, which resulted in a severely diminished rise in free matrix calcium following histamine stimulation as we previously reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055785-Perocchi1">[12]</xref>. Subsequently, we introduced a cDNA encoding either MICU1 (with synonymous mutations at the shRNA sites) or MICU2. As expected, MICU1 robustly restored the rise in matrix calcium following histamine stimulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0055785.s002">Fig. S2c</xref>). Although expression of MICU2 rescued the calcium phenotype, it also restored MICU1 protein levels to approximately half of wild-type levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0055785.s002">Fig. S2c</xref>, d). This result precluded a definitive evaluation of whether MICU2 could compensate for MICU1 because it could be explained by multiple mechanisms, including MICU2 stabilizing low levels of remaining MICU1 or directly replacing MICU1 as a functional paralog. In contrast to mitochondria isolated from mouse liver, it is important to point out that MICU1 knockdown does not result in decreased MCU expression in cultured HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0055785.s002">Fig. S2d</xref>), which may reflect cell-type differential regulation.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Mitochondrial calcium transport is a highly conserved phenomenon that is linked to a diverse set of cellular processes, including cellular metabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055785-Hajnoczky1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055785-Jouaville1">[5]</xref> and programmed cell death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055785-Scorrano1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055785-Moffat1">[26]</xref>. Given the lack of cell-permeant uniporter inhibitors and the previously unknown molecular identity of the uniporter, the functional studies to date have been largely correlative. The discovery of MICU1 and MCU <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055785-Perocchi1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055785-Baughman1">[13]</xref> opens the door to an endless set of targeted genetic and biochemical studies that will enable a detailed molecular understanding of mitochondrial calcium uptake and the mechanisms that govern its regulation.</p>
      <p>MICU1 is a part of a duplicated gene family found in all major branches of life, including metazoans, plants, protozoa and fungi, with lineage specific losses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055785-Bick1">[29]</xref>. In the current paper, we show that MICU1, MICU2 and MICU3 are conserved in vertebrates and that they exhibit distinct patterns of expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055785-g001">Fig. 1b</xref>), suggesting complementary roles in controlling uniporter physiology. Based on MitoCarta, MICU2 is a high confidence mitochondrial-localized protein whereas MICU3 is likely mitochondrial but with lower confidence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055785-Pagliarini1">[18]</xref>. We prioritized MICU2 for functional studies, but MICU3 likely has a role in mitochondrial calcium handling in a subset of tissues, notably in the CNS and skeletal muscle, though this remains to be formally proven. Although we showed in previous work that loss of MICU1 in HeLa cells results in impaired mitochondrial calcium handling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055785-Perocchi1">[12]</xref>, it was unclear if this property extended to other cell types. Our current study extends this finding to mouse liver, establishing the central role of MICU1 in calcium handling in mammalian mitochondria.</p>
      <p>Our biochemical and genetic studies strongly support the notion that MCU, MICU1 and MICU2 reside within a complex. This idea is supported by co-IP experiments as well as by the novel observation of cross-stabilization of these proteins. This was most evident in HEK293T cells in which we performed the majority of our biochemical experiments. Silencing MICU1 resulted in loss of MICU2 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055785-g002">Fig. 2c</xref>), and forced expression of either MICU1 or MCU led to apparent stabilization of MICU1 and MICU2 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055785-g002">Fig. 2b, c</xref>). Similar effects are observed in HeLa cells, where MICU1 protein levels were also sensitive to MICU2 knockdown (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0055785.s002">Fig. S2a</xref>). In mouse liver, we observed that silencing MICU1 or MICU2 led to a shift in the large molecular weight MCU complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055785-g004">Fig. 4d</xref>) previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055785-Baughman1">[13]</xref>. Together, these studies reveal that MICU2 is a genuine member of the uniporter complex.</p>
      <p>At present, the precise molecular function of MICU1, MICU2 and MICU3 remain unclear. In this study, we performed <italic>in vivo</italic> silencing of MICU1 and MICU2, which resulted in reduced mitochondrial calcium clearance in response to large 50 µM calcium pulses. Given the reconstitution data suggesting that MCU is the pore-forming subunit of the uniporter, possible roles for MICU2 could include: (i) Ca2+ sensing and regulation of MCU, (ii) calcium buffering with a secondary impact on transport or (iii) assembly and stabilization of MCU. A recent study provides compelling evidence that MICU1 sets the threshold for mitochondrial calcium uptake without affecting the kinetics properties of the pore <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055785-Mallilankaraman1">[16]</xref>. How MICU2 contributes to this mechanism remains an important outstanding question.</p>
      <p>Although our results show that MICU1 and MICU2 play complementary roles at a physiological level, it remains unclear whether they have distinct or redundant molecular functions. The evolutionary conservation of MICU1, MICU2 and MICU3 in vertebrates, their distinct patterns of expression across organs and the presence of MICU1 and MICU2 in two different cell types indicate complementary roles in cellular physiology. However, it is unclear if they are redundant on a molecular level. We attempted to complement a strong MICU1 phenotype in HeLa cells that we previously reported by expressing MICU2 on a MICU1 knockdown background. Although MICU2 was able to rescue this phenotype, we found that MICU2 also stabilized the protein expression of the small amount of MICU1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0055785.s002">Fig. S2d</xref>), confounding the interpretation. Resolving this question will require the use of a null genetic background in which the activity of one paralog can be rigorously assessed in the absence of the other paralog.</p>
      <p>Our biochemical findings have important implications for the interpretation of functional studies of the uniporter that employ genetic silencing or overexpression. The current study demonstrates that when uniporter protein components are genetically silenced, this perturbation may impact the protein stability of companion proteins, and that cross-stabilization may represent a cell-type specific phenomenon. For example, forced expression of MCU has been reported to give a gain of function phenotype, yet we observe that forced expression of MCU also leads to elevated levels of MICU1 and MICU2 in HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055785-g002">Fig. 2c</xref>). Silencing of MICU1 and MICU2, either alone or in combination, in mouse liver appears to have an impact on the abundance of MCU protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055785-g004">Fig. 4c</xref>), which likely contributed to decreased mitochondrial calcium clearance in these assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055785-g004">Fig. 4a, b</xref>). Cross-stabilization is not unusual in large, protein complexes, including those of the respiratory chain, where the expression of subunits is nucleated and stabilized by other partners. Future studies of the uniporter need to be cognizant of the ability of MCU, MICU1, and MICU2 to impact each other's protein expression, as genetic silencing studies may misattribute a molecular function to the target protein when indeed the impact may be indirect. In addition, it will be important to consider other mechanisms, including those involving MCUR1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055785-Mallilankaraman2">[30]</xref>, LETM1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055785-Jiang1">[31]</xref> and NCLX <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055785-Palty1">[32]</xref> that may additionally influence mitochondrial calcium physiology.</p>
      <p>It is tempting to speculate that the relative expression of MICU1, MICU2 and MICU3 differ in a cell and state-specific manner to regulate mitochondrial calcium handling. Under this model, multiple paralogs could be constitutively expressed in a single cell type, but variation in their relative abundance could give rise to functional differences in mitochondrial calcium handling, as has been previously documented across tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055785-Carafoli1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055785-Sparagna1">[17]</xref>. If this model proves to be correct, it may open up the possibility of therapeutically targeting the uniporter in a tissue specific manner.</p>
