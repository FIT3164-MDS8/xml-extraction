<p>TNF receptor superfamily members, such as CD40 and the Toll-like receptors (TLRs), regulate many aspects of B cell differentiation and activation. TRAF6 is an intracellular signaling adaptor molecule for these receptors, but its role in B cells has not been clarified by previous genetic approaches, as the systemic deletion of the <italic>TRAF6</italic> gene results in perinatal lethality. Here we show that B cell-specific TRAF6 deficiency results in a reduced number of mature B cells in the bone marrow and spleen. Optimal T cell-dependent (TD) antigen responses, as characterized by isotype switching and long-lived plasma cell generation, are also impaired in B cell-specific TRAF6-deficient mice. B cell-specific TRAF6-deficient mice also exhibit lower levels of serum IgM and IgG2b and defective antigen-specific IgM production in response to T cell-independent (TI) antigens. Unexpectedly, TRAF6-deficient B cell progenitors are unable to generate CD5<sup>+</sup> B-1 cells. These results reveal critical roles for TRAF6 in TD and TI humoral immune responses and in inductive fate decisions necessary to generate the B-1 B cell compartment.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Ligands for the Toll-like receptors (TLRs), such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and CpG-DNA, are powerful B cell mitogens, and they also induce proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6 and the surface molecules CD40, B-7 and MHC class II <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004736-Akira1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004736-DeFranco1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004736-Krieg1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004736-Medzhitov1">[4]</xref>. The tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) superfamily member CD40 similarly induces not only clonal B cell expansion but also T cell-dependent (TD) responses, such as germinal center (GC) formation, antibody isotype switching, affinity maturation and differentiation into long-lived plasma cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004736-Banchereau1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004736-Bishop1">[6]</xref>. TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), a member of the TRAF family of cytoplasmic adaptors, transduces signals from the TNFRs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004736-Dempsey1">[7]</xref> as well as from the TLRs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004736-Cao1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004736-Chung1">[9]</xref>, thereby playing a critical role in innate immunity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004736-Kobayashi1">[10]</xref>. TRAF6 is recruited to the motif PXEXXAr/Ac, which is found in the IL-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) adaptor molecules and in the cytoplasmic portion of TNFR family members like CD40 and receptor activator of NF-κB (RANK) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004736-Darnay1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004736-Pullen1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004736-Ye1">[13]</xref>. TRAF6 mediates the activation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases such as p38, Erk and JNK, and NF-κB transcription factors.</p>
<p>TRAFs 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6 are recruited to specific domains in the cytoplasmic tail of CD40. The binding site for TRAF6 is distinct from that of other TRAFs (PXQXT motif), and there are structural differences between receptor recognition by TRAF6 and other TRAFs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004736-Ye1">[13]</xref>. It has been shown that the various TRAFs have some unique and some overlapping functions <italic>in vitro</italic>; however, the roles of each TRAF downstream of CD40 in B cells are not fully understood. Recently, two separate groups examined transgenic mice with CD40 mutations that lack one or both TRAF binding sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004736-Ahonen1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004736-Jabara1">[15]</xref>. One study found that TRAF6 plays a critical role in antibody affinity maturation and the generation of plasma cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004736-Ahonen1">[14]</xref>, whereas the other study concluded that TRAF6 has no discernible role in CD40-mediated activation and antibody class switching <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004736-Jabara1">[15]</xref>. It is difficult to establish the importance of TRAF6 in B cell function from these two studies. The functional readouts examined were different; in addition, in one study the mutant CD40 molecule was widely expressed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004736-Ahonen1">[14]</xref>, while in the other it was expressed exclusively in B cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004736-Jabara1">[15]</xref>. Finally, neither of these studies was designed to determine CD40-independent functions of TRAF6 in B cells.</p>
<p>There are difficulties associated with examining the role of different TRAFs in mature B cells using <italic>TRAF</italic> gene deletions. TRAF2-, 3-, 6-deficient mice die <italic>in utero</italic> or shortly after birth, suffering from multiple abnormalities in various organs. TRAF6-deficient mice develop osteopetrosis and occlusion of the bone marrow (BM) cavities from a lack of osteoclast function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004736-Lomaga1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004736-Naito1">[17]</xref>. The BM is an anatomically important site for early B cell development and for antibody production by plasma cells. Moreover, TRAF6-deficient mice lack lymph nodes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004736-Naito1">[17]</xref> and therefore cannot support normal T cell-B cell interactions during the course of an immune response. Not unexpectedly, there are very few splenic B cells in these mice (approximately 5%, data not shown). Hence, analysis of the physiologic function of TRAF6 in B cells has not been amenable to genetic approaches.</p>
<p>In order to clarify the physiologic role of TRAF6 in the regulation of B cell development and function, we created B cell-specific TRAF6-deficient mice by crossing floxed TRAF6 mice (in which a <italic>TRAF6</italic> exon is flanked by <italic>lox</italic>P sites) with CD19-Cre mice. TRAF6 appears to influence several processes in B cell development and function. The mutant mice have fewer mature B cells in the BM and spleen and mount sub-optimal TD-antigen responses. Additionally, baseline IgM production as well as T cell-independent (TI) antigen-specific IgM production is severely impaired, most likely as a result of the complete absence of CD5<sup>+</sup> B-1 cells (B-1a cells) in the peritoneal cavity. Our findings suggest novel functions for TRAF6, which appears to be required for both B-1 and B-2 cell homeostasis and to play a role in both in TI and TD humoral immune responses.</p>

<title>Generation of B cell-specific TRAF6-deficient mice</title>
<p>In order to study the physiologic functions of TRAF6 in B lymphocytes, we generated B cell-specific TRAF6-deficient mice (TRAF6-ΔB mice). To generate offspring in which <italic>TRAF6</italic> was deleted only in B cells, TRAF6<sup>flox/flox</sup> mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004736-King1">[18]</xref> were crossed with CD19-Cre mice, in which the expression of Cre recombinase is driven by the CD19 promoter. B cell-specific deletion of the <italic>TRAF6</italic> gene was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (data not shown) and western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004736-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). Purified B cells from spleen of CD19<sup>Cre/+</sup>TRAF6<sup>flox/flox</sup> mice contained almost undetectable levels of TRAF6 protein, although a substantial amount of TRAF6 was present in non-B splenocytes as well as in B cells from control mice. Similar results were obtained from CD19<sup>Cre/+</sup>TRAF6<sup>flox/−</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004736-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). Thus, CD19<sup>Cre/+</sup>TRAF6<sup>flox/flox</sup> and CD19<sup>Cre/+</sup>TRAF6<sup>flox/−</sup> mice were used interchangeably. TRAF6-ΔB mice were born at the expected Mendelian ratio and exhibited normal growth rates, without inflammatory lesions or osteopetrosis.</p>

<title>TRAF6 deficiency in B cells results in defective proliferation, IL-6 production and signaling in response to TLR ligands and anti-CD40</title>

Proliferation of TRAF6-ΔB B cells in response to LPS, CpG-DNA and anti-CD40 Ab was severely impaired, while proliferation induced by BCR crosslinking was comparable to the control B cells. In addition, LPS- and CpG-DNA-induced production of IL-6 was nearly abolished in the TRAF6-ΔB B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004736-g002">Fig. 2b</xref>).</p>

Control B cells stimulated with CpG-DNA induced phosphorylation of p38, Erk, JNK, Akt and IκBα, as well as IκBα degradation within 15 min. However, these events were significantly impaired in B cells from TRAF6-ΔB mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004736-g002">Fig. 2c, left panels</xref>). Notably, phosphorylation of p38 was undetectable in TRAF6-deficient B cells. Similar results were observed in B cells stimulated with anti-CD40 Ab (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004736-g002">Fig. 2c, right panels</xref>) or LPS (data not shown). These results suggest that TRAF6 mediates signals from TLRs and CD40 that regulate B cell proliferation and cytokine production.</p>

<p>In marked contrast to early B cell development in the BM, B220<sup>high</sup>IgM<sup>+</sup>IgD<sup>+</sup> mature recirculating B cells were significantly diminished in TRAF6-ΔB mice (12.8±1.3% in TRAF6-ΔB compared to 20.2±2.3% in controls, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004736-g003">Fig. 3a, top and middle panels</xref>). This deficiency is reflected in the absolute cell numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004736-g003">Fig. 3a, bottom</xref>). In the spleen, the percentage of B cells (CD19<sup>+</sup>B220<sup>+</sup>) was also significantly reduced in TRAF6-ΔB mice (39.2±7.1% compared to 50.3±4.8% in the control mice, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004736-g003">Fig. 3b, upper panels</xref>; absolute numbers shown in the lowest panel). The reduction was more prominent in the IgM<sup>low</sup>IgD<sup>high</sup>AA4.1<sup>−</sup> mature B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004736-g003">Fig. 3b, middle panels</xref>) than in the IgM<sup>high</sup>IgD<sup>low</sup>AA4.1<sup>+</sup> transitional B cells, which are their developmental precursors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004736-Allman1">[19]</xref>. This finding suggests that TRAF6 regulates the late step of mature B cell development or homeostasis. Within the mature subset, the ratios of the CD21<sup>+</sup>CD23<sup>+</sup> follicular B cell subset and CD21<sup>high</sup>CD23<sup>−</sup> marginal zone (MZ) B cell subset were almost identical between TRAF6-ΔB and control mice. Furthermore, immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis of spleen sections from TRAF6-ΔB mice revealed normal splenic architecture, with typical T cell areas surrounded by follicular and MZ B cell areas, separated by MOMA1<sup>+</sup> metallophilic macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004736-g003">Fig. 3c</xref>).</p>

<title>Cell survival and alternative NF-κB signaling are intact in TRAF6-deficient B cells</title>
<p>Since mature B cell numbers in TRAF6-ΔB mice were reduced, we examined <italic>ex vivo</italic> survival of splenic B cells from TRAF6-ΔB and control mice cultured with or without serum or in the presence of anti-BCR Ab. Both control and TRAF6-deficient B cells showed similar percentages (approximately 30%) of apoptotic B cells (sub-G0 peak) after 14 hr in the presence of serum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004736-g004">Fig. 4a</xref>). This percentage was increased to approximately 50% by serum depletion or BCR crosslinking. Similar results were obtained when transitional B cells isolated from sub-lethally irradiated TRAF6-ΔB and control mice were used (data not shown). These results suggest that TRAF6 deficiency does not affect B cell survival or susceptibility to apoptosis, arguing that the defects observed were a consequence of impaired fate determination rather than homeostasis.</p>

Consistent with previous reports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004736-Claudio1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004736-Kayagaki1">[24]</xref>, CD40 ligation induced processing of NF-κB2 as well as upregulation of p100 and RelB, indicating the activation of both canonical and alternative pathways, whereas LPS treatment induced only the canonical pathway. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004736-g005">Fig. 5b</xref>, B cells from TRAF6-ΔB mice exhibited normal processing of p100 to p52 in response to BAFF and anti-CD40 Ab. However, upregulation of p100 and RelB was obviously impaired in response to both LPS and anti-CD40 Ab, suggesting defective canonical NF-κB activation. This finding is consistent with the observed defect in IκBα phosphorylation and degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004736-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). Therefore, TRAF6 is selectively required for canonical NF-κB activation upon TLR or CD40 stimulation but not for activation of the alternative pathway downstream of CD40 or BAFF-R. Again, these results point towards a role for TRAF6 in B cell subset specification rather than in generating survival signals for homeostasis.</p>

Given that CD40 signaling is impaired in the TRAF6-ΔB mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004736-g002">Fig. 2</xref>), we examined TD immune responses. TRAF6-ΔB and control mice were immunized intraperitoneally with sheep erythrocytes and examined by flow cytometry and IHC analysis for the formation of GCs. Flow cytometric analysis of spleen cells from TRAF6-ΔB and control mice stained for the GC markers peanut agglutinin (PNA) and GL7 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004736-Cervenak1">[27]</xref> revealed that GL7<sup>+</sup>PNA<sup>+</sup> GC B cells were induced at comparable ratios (3.80±0.86% in TRAF6-ΔB vs. 3.28±0.27% in control mice, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004736-g005">Fig. 5a and b</xref>). Moreover, IHC analysis showed that PNA<sup>+</sup> GCs were present in the B cell areas in both TRAF6-ΔB and control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004736-g005">Fig. 5c</xref>), indicating that TRAF6 is not required for GC formation induced by TD antigens.</p>
<p>TRAF6-ΔB, CD40-deficient and control mice were also immunized with a separate TD antigen, NP-KLH, and the primary responses were measured 7 days later. NP-specific IgM production was comparable to control and CD40-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004736-g006">Fig. 6a</xref>). Levels of NP-specific IgG1 and IgG2b were diminished as compared to those in control mice, though still higher than in the CD40-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004736-g006">Fig. 6b and c</xref>). During the secondary response measured 14 days after boosting, the levels of NP-specific IgG1 and IgG2b were augmented in the TRAF6-ΔB mice, though still lower than in the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004736-g006">Fig. 6b and c</xref>). These results suggest that antigen-specific isotype switching still occurs in the absence of TRAF6, albeit inefficiently.</p>

<p>We also examined affinity maturation by comparing the level of antibodies captured by NP<sub>30</sub>-BSA against those captured by NP<sub>3</sub>-BSA in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004736-Ahonen1">[14]</xref>. About half or less of the total antigen-specific IgG1 and IgG2b was high-affinity Ig during the primary response in the control mice; in the secondary response, almost all the IgG1 and IgG2b antibody was high affinity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004736-g006">Fig. 6b and c</xref>). Although total antigen-specific IgG1 and IgG2b levels were lower in TRAF6-ΔB mice, the proportion of high-affinity antibody was identical to that in the control during secondary responses, suggesting that TRAF6 is not required for affinity maturation, possibly because other TRAFs downstream of CD40 can compensate for the lack of TRAF6.</p>
<p>We also measured the terminal differentiation of B cells into plasma cells. The numbers of long-lived antibody-secreting cells in the BM of TRAF6-ΔB, CD40-deficient and control mice were compared by enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004736-g006">Fig. 6d</xref>). The number of plasma cells secreting NP-specific IgG1 was reduced in TRAF6-ΔB mice, indicating that TRAF6 plays a role in this terminal differentiation step. Our results indicate that TRAF6 is selectively required for specific CD40 functions during the response to TD antigen.</p>

<p>Consistent with defects in TI immune responses, TRAF6-ΔB mice also showed a reduced level of circulating antibody at steady states.

<title>TRAF6 is required for B-1a cell development in the peritoneal cavity</title>
<p>B-1a cells are thought to potentiate responses to certain TI antigens and/or to be the major source of circulating antibody (which is primarily IgM) in the absence of overt antigen exposure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004736-Carsetti1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004736-Berland1">[29]</xref>. Therefore, we first examined whether B-1a cell development is affected in TRAF6-ΔB mice. The overall number of cells in the peritoneal exudates of the TRAF6-ΔB mice was about 40% less than the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004736-g008">Fig. 8a</xref>). The ratio of total CD19<sup>+</sup> B cells was significantly reduced in the peritoneal exudate cells of TRAF6-ΔB mice (44.9±6.6% of total cells compared 67.2±5.9% in the control, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004736-g008">Fig. 8b, upper panels</xref>). Within B cell populations, the proportion of the CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD23<sup>−</sup> B-1 cell subset in TRAF6-ΔB mice was particularly affected, with the proportion of CD11b<sup>−</sup>CD23<sup>+</sup> B-2 cells being correspondingly higher (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004736-g008">Fig. 8b, middle panels</xref>). Since the total B cell number was reduced in TRAF6-ΔB mice, the percentage of B-2 cells in the total peritoneal exudate was identical to that of control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004736-g008">Fig. 8c</xref>). Most notably, the CD5<sup>+</sup> B-1a <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004736-Berland1">[29]</xref> cells within the B-1 compartment were almost completely absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004736-g008">Fig. 8b, lower panels</xref>). Because both CD19<sup>Cre/+</sup>TRAF6<sup>+/+</sup> and CD19<sup>+/+</sup>TRAF6<sup>flox/flox</sup> control mice showed identical ratios of CD5<sup>+</sup> B-1a cells in the peritoneal exudate (data not shown), the deficiency in TRAF6-ΔB mice could be attributed to <italic>TRAF6</italic> deficiency rather than to haploinsufficiency of the <italic>CD19</italic> gene. We hypothesized that if either CD40 or the TLRs regulate B-1a cell development through TRAF6, we would see a similar phenotype in the corresponding knockout mouse. However, neither CD40-deficient nor MyD88/TRIF-doubly deficient mice had any deficiency in B-1a cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004736-g008">Fig. 8d</xref>). This intriguing finding suggests that unique TRAF6-dependent receptors are crucial for B-1a cell regulation.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here we have investigated the importance of the signaling adaptor TRAF6 to B cell development and function. Our previous study emphasized the role of TRAF6 in innate immunity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004736-Kobayashi1">[10]</xref>; however, the role of TRAF6 in lymphocytes and adaptive immunity has not been established. Because of the breadth and severity of the <italic>TRAF6</italic>-deficient phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004736-Lomaga1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004736-Naito1">[17]</xref>, we generated B cell-specific TRAF6-deficient (TRAF6-ΔB) mice.</p>
<p>Our results demonstrate a broad role for TRAF6 in B lymphocyte development and function. Mature B cell populations in the BM and spleen are reduced, though the pro-, pre- and immature B cells in the BM and transitional B cells in the spleen are of normal numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004736-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). Although the proliferative response of TRAF6-deficient B cells induced by TLR ligands and CD40 ligation was severely impaired, BCR crosslinking induced normal proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004736-g002">Fig. 2a</xref>). Moreover, this impairment does not appear to be the result of increased susceptibility to apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004736-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). It has been shown recently that BAFF-induced survival plays an important role in the maintenance and homeostasis of the peripheral B cell pool <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004736-Mackay1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004736-Patke1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004736-Schneider1">[22]</xref>. However, we show that signaling from BAFF-R was normal in TRAF6-ΔB cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004736-g004">Fig. 4</xref>), suggesting that yet-to-be-elucidated molecules activate TRAF6-mediated signals required for generation or maintenance of the mature B cell pool. These results thus suggest a previously unexpected complexity in the nature of signals necessary for these processes.</p>
<p>CD40 signaling is known to be important in certain antigen-driven phenomena in TD immune responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004736-Castigli1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004736-Kawabe1">[26]</xref>. In conjunction with the defect in CD40 signaling <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004736-g002">Fig. 2</xref>), we found isotype switching to IgG1 and IgG2b in response to TD antigen was severely impaired, as was the generation of long-lived plasma cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004736-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). Intriguingly, other CD40-dependent processes, such as affinity maturation and GC formation, were unaffected. This finding indicates that a specific subset of CD40 functions operate through TRAF6.</p>
<p>Our most surprising observation is the complete lack of CD5<sup>+</sup> B-1a cells in the peritoneal cavity of TRAF6-ΔB mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004736-g008">Fig. 8</xref>), which is accompanied by lowered basal levels of serum IgM or “natural” antibody and sub-optimal TI immune responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004736-g007">Fig. 7</xref>). Both phenomena are postulated to be largely dependent on peritoneal B-1 cells and MZ B cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004736-Berland1">[29]</xref>. Mutations of positive regulators of BCR signaling, such as PKCβ, PKCγ, PI-3K, BLNK, Vav-1 and CD19, are known to result in a reduction in B-1 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004736-Berland1">[29]</xref>. Since there were no defects in BCR responses <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004736-g002">Fig. 2</xref>), we were concerned that the B-1a defect may be the result of CD19 haploinsufficiency of the TRAF6-ΔB mice, which are CD19<sup>Cre/+</sup>TRAF6<sup>flox/flox</sup> or CD19<sup>Cre/+</sup>TRAF6<sup>flox/−</sup>. However this was not the case, since CD19<sup>Cre/+</sup>TRAF6<sup>+/+</sup> mice exhibit normal ratios of peritoneal B-1a cells. It has been shown that the combined loss of the NF-κB subunits p50 and c-Rel diminishes the peritoneal CD5<sup>+</sup> B-1a cell population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004736-Pohl1">[30]</xref>. Given that the canonical NF-κB pathway is impaired in TRAF6-ΔB mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004736-g002">Figs 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004736-g004">4</xref>), it appears that a TRAF6/NF-κB pathway is essential for the development of peritoneal CD5<sup>+</sup> B-1a cells. Curiously, neither CD40-deficient nor MyD88/TRIF-doubly deficient (thus defective in TLR signaling) mice have impaired B1-a cell development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004736-g008">Fig. 8c</xref>). These results suggest that signals from a receptor(s) other than CD40 or TLRs regulate B-1a cell development or that CD40 and TLRs compensate for each other's loss. The importance of BCR function in B-1 cell development has long been appreciated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004736-Berland1">[29]</xref>. However, the involvement of TLRs and other receptors for bacterial products is controversial. It was demonstrated that the administration of LPS or the presence of enteric bacteria is necessary for the development of B-1 cells in anti-RBC autoantibody-transgenic mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004736-Murakami1">[31]</xref>. Future experiments will be necessary to identify which cell surface receptors are necessary for TRAF6-mediated B-1 cell development.</p>
<p>We have demonstrated that TRAF6 is involved in a wide variety of B cell processes. It is crucial for certain CD40 effector functions in B cells during TD humoral immune responses and also for the generation of optimal TI immune responses. In addition, TRAF6 is necessary for B-1a cell development and for the maintenance of the mature B cell pool. Understanding the regulation of this adaptor protein therefore will contribute to our knowledge of B cell function in the development of the immune system and during its response to antigen.</p>

For the secondary response, these mice were boosted intraperitoneally with antigen (50 µg/mouse) 14 days after immunization, and sera were collected 14 days after this boost. For GC formation, mice were immunized intraperitoneally with sheep erythrocytes without adjuvant.</p>

<title>ELISpot assay</title>
<p>Long-lived antibody-producing plasma cells were detected by ELISpot assay using a Protein Detector ELISpot Kit (Kirkegaard &amp; Perry Laboratories, Inc.). Mice were immunized with NP-KLH as described above. 60 days after immunization, BM cells were harvested and plated in triplicate at 2×10<sup>6</sup> cells/well in NP-BSA coated 96-well PVDF plates, which were incubated for 4–6 hr at 37°C in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator and then washed with PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20. Spots were developed with HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG1 followed by the TrueBlue chromogen substrate, and they were counted under a dissection microscope or with an ELISpot plate reader.</p>

<title>GC formation</title>
<p>Ten days after immunization with sheep erythrocytes, spleens were collected and subjected to flow cytometry and IHC. For flow cytometry, single-cell suspensions were stained for B220, CD19, GL7 and PNA (Vector Laboratories). For IHC, frozen sections were stained with anti-CD3-PE-Cy5, anti-B220-PE-TexasRed and PNA-FITC or anti-MOMA1-FITC (Serotec).</p>
