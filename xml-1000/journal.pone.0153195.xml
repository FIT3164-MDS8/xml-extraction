<abstract>
<p>Influenza has a major impact on the elderly due to increased susceptibility to infection with age and poor response to current vaccines. We have studied universal influenza vaccine candidates based on influenza A nucleoprotein and matrix 2 (A/NP+M2). Long-lasting protection against influenza virus strains of divergent subtypes is induced, especially with mucosal immunization. Here, we tested universal vaccination in BALB/c mice of different ages. Vaccination used intramuscular DNA priming to A/NP+M2 followed by intranasal (i.n.) boosting with recombinant adenoviruses (rAd) expressing the same antigens, or only A/NP+M2-rAd given i.n. Antigen-specific systemic antibody responses were induced in young, middle-aged, and elderly mice (2, 11–17, and 20 months old, respectively), but decreased with age. Antibody responses in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were detected only in young mice. Antigen-specific T cell responses were seen in young and middle-aged but not elderly mice. A/NP+M2 vaccination by the two regimens above protected against stringent challenge in young and middle-aged mice, but not in elderly mice. However, mice vaccinated with A/NP-rAd or A/M2-rAd during their youth were partially protected against challenge 16 months later when they were elderly. In addition, a regimen of two doses of A/NP+M2-rAd given i.n. one month apart beginning in old age protected elderly mice against stringent challenge. This study highlights the potential benefit of cross-protective vaccines through middle age, and suggests that their performance might be enhanced in elderly individuals who had been exposed to influenza antigens early in life, as most humans have been, or by a two-dose rAd regimen given later in life.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Influenza poses a public health threat, especially to the very young, elderly, or chronically ill. Influenza killed about 10,000–20,000 people 65 years and older in the US alone in 2006–2007 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153195.ref001">1</xref>]. Lower vaccine efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153195.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153195.ref003">3</xref>] due to reduced immune function and underlying illnesses may contribute to susceptibility of the elderly. Conventional influenza vaccines are poorly immunogenic in the elderly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153195.ref004">4</xref>], with at least 20% of elderly recipients failing to develop protective hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) antibody titers after vaccination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153195.ref005">5</xref>]. Given the increasing elderly population, it is critical to evaluate how the senescent immune system responds to vaccines, and to develop strategies to improve vaccine effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153195.ref006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153195.ref007">7</xref>].</p>
<p>Vaccination is a valuable public health strategy for controlling influenza. However, viral mutation and reassortment frequently alter the neutralizing antibody targets hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), rendering existing vaccines ineffective. Preparation of updated strain-matched vaccines takes months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153195.ref008">8</xref>]. An attractive alternative would be universal influenza vaccines inducing heterosubtypic immunity against relatively conserved influenza proteins. Such vaccines would protect against diverse influenza virus strains of all subtypes (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153195.ref009">9</xref>]). However, vaccines targeting conserved antigens do not induce neutralizing antibodies and so do not prevent infection. Instead they limit disease severity, viral replication and shedding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153195.ref009">9</xref>], and transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153195.ref010">10</xref>]. Universal vaccine candidates have been based on M2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153195.ref011">11</xref>], NP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153195.ref012">12</xref>], NP+M2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153195.ref013">13</xref>], M1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153195.ref014">14</xref>], HA-stem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153195.ref015">15</xref>] and attenuated influenza viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153195.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153195.ref017">17</xref>].</p>
<p>We have shown that DNA prime-recombinant adenovirus (rAd) boost vaccination to highly conserved influenza antigens A/NP+M2 induces effective cross-protective immunity against H1N1, H3N2, and H5N1 challenges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153195.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153195.ref018">18</xref>]. We subsequently showed that single-dose rAd was effective with or without DNA priming. In mice, rAd was more effective when given intranasally (i.n.) than intramuscularly (i.m.), resulting in increased survival, decreased morbidity, and reduced lung viral titers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153195.ref019">19</xref>]. Increased virus-specific IgA responses and stronger lung T cell responses were induced by i.n. rAd and likely contributed to its effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153195.ref019">19</xref>].</p>
<p>Because cellular immune responses are decreased in the elderly, it is important to assess the capacity of cross-protective vaccines which utilize not only antibody but also cellular responses to protect the aged population. Therefore, we tested A/NP+M2 vaccination in mice 2, 11–17, and 20 months old, approximating young (˂20 years old), middle-aged (40–54 years old), and elderly (roughly 56–69 years old) humans respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153195.ref020">20</xref>]. We measured antibody and T cell responses in systemic and mucosal samples, and protection against challenge, and explored additional vaccination regimens with potential to protect the elderly.</p>

<p>Female BALB/cAnNCr mice 4 weeks old were purchased from the National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD and rested until use. Female BALB/cBy mice 20 months old were purchased from the National Institute on Aging/Charles River (Kingston, NY). BALB/cJ animals from Jackson Laboratories were kindly provided by Maryna Eichelberger, CBER/FDA at 11 months of age and rested until use. BALB/cBy and BALB/cJ mice 4 weeks old were bought from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). Use of multiple BALB/c sublines was necessitated by difficulties obtaining aged mice. Each experiment used young and old mice of matched subline and supplier to control for genetic effects.</p>

<title>Mouse immunizations and challenge infections</title>
<p>DNA priming used 50 μg each of A/NP and A/M2 DNA or 100 μg of B/NP DNA (control), i.m., 50 μl in each quadriceps. Mice received a boost with rAd four weeks later, 10<sup>10</sup> total viral particles/mouse in 50 μl i.n. under isoflurane anesthesia. Some additional mice received rAd as sole immunization, or two rAd doses, one month apart, also given i.n. under anesthesia. For challenge, mice were infected i.n. under isoflurane anesthesia with A/FM-ma at indicated doses. Body weight and survival until weight loss endpoint were followed until surviving animals were recovering weight. After influenza virus challenge, the animals were observed twice daily including weekends (once by laboratory staff, once by vivarium staff). The animals were weighed once per day during this time. Deaths in groups that had not been challenged with influenza virus were very infrequent and occurred only in the elderly groups. Mice were euthanized if weight fell below 75% of individual starting weight, unless specified otherwise. The study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. This study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees at the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER; Protocol #1991–06) and carried out in animal facilities accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International. Experiments were performed according to institutional guidelines. Vaccination of different age groups in a figure was not always carried out simultaneously. When it was, that is indicated in the figure legends.</p>

After incubation, cells were washed and stained with Live/Dead fixable blue viability stain Vivid for UV excitation (Invitrogen). Mouse CD16/32-specific monoclonal antibody 2.4G2 was added to cells before incubation with anti-CD3-PerCp-Cy5.5, anti-CD8-APC-Cy7, anti-CD4-AF700 (all from BD Biosciences), anti-CD107a, and NP147–155-H2-Kd Tetramer-APC.

<p>Cytotoxic activity was assessed by flow cytometry. As targets, naïve BALB/c splenocytes were labeled for an <italic>ex vixo</italic> cytotoxicity assay as described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153195.ref029">29</xref>] with either carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE) or chloromethyl-benzoyl-amino-tetramethyl-rhodamine (CMTMR) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Cells labeled with CFSE were pulsed with a mixture of 1 mM each of NP<sub>147-155</sub>, NP<sub>55-69</sub>, and M2e<sub>2-24</sub> peptides (target epitopes), or with SARS M peptide. Cells labelled with CMTMR were pulsed with SARS as a specificity control. Assays were performed in round-bottom 96-well plates with a 10:1 effector to target cell ratio. Lung lymphocytes from A/NP+M2 or B/NP immunized mice or mice infected with A/Mex under isoflurane were used as effectors. Cells were additionally stained with blue dead cell stain Vivid. After 5–6 hours in culture, 30,000 events were acquired on a Fortessa flow cytometer and analysis performed on gated live cells. The reduction in peptide-pulsed CFSE-labeled cells relative to the internal negative control of SARS-pulsed CMTMR-labeled cells served as a measure of specific cytotoxicity. SARS-pulsed CFSE-labeled cells were used to measure non-specific death. Percent specific cell death for both CFSE and CMTMR-stained cells is defined as 100 x [(% dead targets—% non-specific dead targets)/ (100%—non-specific dead targets)] with dead cells as defined by Vivid<sup>+</sup> staining.</p>

<p>GraphPad Prism 6.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) was used for graphing and log-rank analysis, SigmaPlot12 (Systat Software Inc., San Jose, CA) for remaining statistics. Comparison of survival used log-rank (Mantel-Cox) testing. T cell responses to influenza peptides were first compared to SARS M responses by paired t-tests. For those responses differing from SARS M, comparison of multiple vaccination groups used one-way ANOVA followed by pairwise comparisons by Holm-Sidak testing or Mann-Whitney rank sum testing when normality or equal variance failed. Viral titers were compared by one-way ANOVA. When additional pilot groups were run in an experiment, although not shown, we included them in ANOVA to apply the penalty for more groups.</p>

<title>Systemic and mucosal antibody responses decrease with age</title>
<p>In some previous work, we used three i.m. DNA doses followed by i.n. rAd boost. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153195.ref018">18</xref>]. For the present study, a single DNA priming dose was chosen as a streamlined regimen for emergency use. In many of the immunization groups, we tested both the DNA prime-rAd-boost regimen and the rAd i.n. without DNA priming. DNA priming is not necessary for protection in young animals, but was included for comparison in parts of the present study in case the requirements for protection were different in mice of different ages.</p>
<p>We immunized mice of different ages to A/NP+M2 using DNA i.m. followed by A/NP+M2-rAd i.n. boost, or A/NP+M2-rAd i.n. alone. Controls received B/NP DNA i.m. with B/NP-rAd i.n. boost. For the rAd vaccines we chose the i.n. route, because this route is more effective for rAd immunization than i.m., whether for boosting or alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153195.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153195.ref019">19</xref>].</p>

Sera and BAL were collected two to three weeks after the rAd immunization. ELISA testing of all serum samples, and of all BAL samples, was simultaneous. Antibody responses were measured by ELISA as described in Materials and Methods, on plates coated with NP or M2e as indicated. For serum (Fig 1A–1D), plates were developed with enzyme conjugates recognizing total IgG. For BAL (Fig 1E–1H), plates were developed with conjugates recognizing total IgA.

Early priming with influenza virus was also reported to lead to long-term maintanance of memory T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153195.ref036">36</xref>]. We explored whether A/NP+M2 vaccination, which protects in part via T-cell activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153195.ref023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153195.ref024">24</xref>], might show a similar impact of priming early in life. We had mice vaccinated i.n. twice at two and three months of age with A/NP-rAd or A/M2-rAd, or B/NP-rAd, and held them until they reached 20 months of age. We challenged these animals with 10<sup>3</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub> A/FM-ma to test for long-term protection provided by the early vaccination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153195.g007">Fig 7A and 7B</xref>). The mice immunized to A/NP or A/M2 lost less weight than controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153195.g007">Fig 7A</xref>) and approximately half of them survived (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153195.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). B/NP-vaccinated controls all reached the weight loss endpoint. This result suggests that a universal vaccine, even one containing a single antigen, can provide some long-term protection extending into old age.</p>

<p>We then considered the possibility that a rAd boost might strengthen protection in the elderly. Elderly mice were immunized with rAd i.n. twice at an interval of one month. Groups were given A/NP-rAd or A/M2-rAd, or A/NP+M2 rAd, or B/NP-rAd. Two month-old mice were used as controls. Antibody responses were measured in these groups of mice. Serum IgG responses to NP and M2e in old mice were somewhat weaker than in young mice; there was some increase in antibody after the boost (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0153195.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). We also measured serum IgG responses to adenovirus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0153195.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). Responses were minimal after priming in both age groups. They increased after the boost, more so in young mice than in old. These groups of mice were challenged one month after the second rAd dose with 10<sup>3</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub> A/FM-ma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153195.g007">Fig 7C–7F</xref>). The young mice immunized to A/NP or A/M2 or A/NP+M2 lost less weight than controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153195.g007">Fig 7C</xref>), with vaccination to A/NP+M2 giving the best protection as we have seen before [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153195.ref013">13</xref>], and all three of the vaccine groups survived (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153195.g007">Fig 7D</xref>). Weight loss was more severe in the elderly mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153195.g007">Fig 7E</xref>), but approximately 43% of the A/M2-rAd-, 57% of the A/NP-rAd- and all of the A/NP+M2-rAd-vaccinated mice survived (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153195.g007">Fig 7F</xref>). B/NP-vaccinated controls all reached the weight loss endpoint. These results are evidence that universal vaccination of this type can provide some protection to elderly recipients if they are given two doses.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Given the dramatic differences in influenza risk with age, it is important to study new candidate vaccines for their potential to protect different age groups. Alternative adjuvants, doses, and routes of administration are being explored to overcome limitations in effectiveness (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153195.ref037">37</xref>]). We tested a candidate universal influenza vaccine in mice of different ages, both for immune responses and for protection against challenge infection.</p>
<p>Mice two and 11 months old responded with systemic and mucosal antibodies, as well as with influenza virus-specific memory T cells in the lungs demonstrated by tetramer analysis. Analysis of surface markers showed high levels of activated effector memory T cells in the lungs of mice immunized at 2 months and 11 months. Moreover, vaccination of young mice increased IFN-γ secreting cells as measured by ELISPOT, CD107a expression, and influenza virus-specific cytotoxic activity of lung cells. Substantial T cell responses to A/NP+M2 were observed by ELISPOT even in mice 16 months of age, but antibody responses declined by this age, especially in the mucosal compartment. By 20 months of age, mice showed greatly impaired cellular and humoral immune responses to vaccination. The limited availability of elderly animals for purchase and attrition in groups we aged in our facility meant we could not perform all experiment types with mice 20 months old. However, T cell ELISPOT responses at this age were marginal. Antibody responses were detectable but lower in sera than in young mice, and negligible in BAL.</p>
<p>Immunization with A/NP+M2-rAd given once protected young and middle-aged mice up to 17 months of age against challenge with virulent mouse-adapted A/FM-ma. B/NP-immunized controls were not protected, as all of them reached the weight loss endpoint, confirming that protection is antigen-specific.</p>
<p>Both antibodies and T cell immunity may contribute to protection. While antibodies to NP and M2 are not neutralizing, they can be protective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153195.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153195.ref023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153195.ref038">38</xref>]. The mechanism could be antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153195.ref039">39</xref>] and perhaps also intracellular disruption of viral replication, as seen in a variety of other examples reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153195.ref040">40</xref>].</p>
<p>In mice, passively transferred A/M2-specific antibody reduced influenza A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153195.ref023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153195.ref041">41</xref>], but not influenza B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153195.ref041">41</xref>], virus replication. Pre-existing immune responses including M2- and NP-specific antibodies in BAL and lung-resident virus-specific T cells with an activated effector memory phenotype, are likely to be important for early control of infection at the respiratory mucosa. Crucially, unlike naïve T cells, effector memory T-cells can immediately exert antiviral functions, including secretion of perforin, granzymes, and cytokines such as IFN-γ, upon encountering the challenge virus. While cytotoxic activity is generally thought to be protective, some argue that CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell stimulation might exacerbate disease, as shown in old mice for one regimen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153195.ref042">42</xref>]. We saw no evidence of exacerbated morbidity (weight loss) with A/NP+M2 vaccine compared to control.</p>
<p>Both mice and humans show impaired T cell responses with age. Age-related changes in protein phosphorylation involved in T lymphocyte proliferation have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153195.ref043">43</xref>], and responses to mitogens are blunted in old compared to young mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153195.ref043">43</xref>]. Following influenza virus infection of immunized mice, <italic>in vitro</italic> restimulated T cell responses are delayed and decreased in old compared to young mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153195.ref044">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153195.ref045">45</xref>]. In humans, immune responses are greatly affected by aging, with decreased antibody responses and lower T cell proliferation and cytotoxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153195.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153195.ref046">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153195.ref049">49</xref>], which affect recovery from infection (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153195.ref050">50</xref>]). The elderly also possess a reduced proportion of naïve cells and decreased repertoire diversity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153195.ref051">51</xref>], thus decreasing their potential to respond to new antigens.</p>
<p>Although their response to new antigens is impaired, cytotoxic T cell responses in old mice are greatly enhanced if the mice had been primed while young [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153195.ref035">35</xref>]. We explored the implications of this for vaccination with A/NP-rAd or M2-rAd given twice in youth. Despite the 16-month gap between vaccination and challenge at 20 months, partial protection was seen. We had shown previously that a single vaccination to A/NP+M2 in young mice provided protection against virulent challenge 8–10 months later [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153195.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153195.ref019">19</xref>], but this is our first demonstration of protection in elderly mice.</p>
<p>In the hope of developing a regimen effective when begun in old age, we examined a regimen using two doses of rAd. This regimen was successful in protecting elderly mice. The improvement in protection compared to a single dose may be due to the boosting, since antibody responses to NP and M2 rose after the second dose (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0153195.s003">S3 Fig</xref>) Alternatively, improved protection may be due to response kinetics, with the delay in challenge providing a longer time interval for immune response maturation.</p>
<p>A potential drawback to this two-dose rAd regimen is that prior exposure to Ad of the same serotype could interfere with vaccine effectiveness, but use of the intranasal route has been reported to circumvent prior anti-Ad immunity to a considerable extent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153195.ref052">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153195.ref053">53</xref>]. Indeed, in our system, the antibody response to adenovirus was marginal after one i.n. dose and considerable only after the boost (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0153195.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). Thus blocking might not be induced by a single dose. Humans have blocking antibody from a different source, namely prior wild type adenovirus infections. However, alternative vectors such as those based on Pan Adenovirus type 3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153195.ref054">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153195.ref055">55</xref>] or other nonhuman primate adenovirus vectors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153195.ref056">56</xref>] are being developed and are not neutralized by antibodies widely circulating in the human population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153195.ref055">55</xref>].</p>
<p>We and others have discussed previously the protective value of heterosubtypic immunity (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153195.ref009">9</xref>]) and others have emphasized the potential downside of annual strain-matched vaccination, which can provide sterilizing immunity but thereby preclude beneficial T cell priming induced by infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153195.ref057">57</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153195.ref059">59</xref>]. The universal vaccine studied here would induce broad cross-protective immunity, including T cell priming, without the health risks of undergoing a wild type influenza virus infection. Critically, elderly humans have been primed by previous infections, asymptomatic exposures, and/or live-attenuated influenza vaccines, and may thus respond to A/NP+M2 vaccination more strongly than elderly SPF mice that have never had such previous exposures.</p>
<p>Our findings suggest advantages to offering immunization while the immune system is young and optimally responsive in order to protect later in life. Vaccination during youth to antigens conserved in all influenza viruses might not only enhance function at the time, but have a lasting impact by stimulating relevant repertoire elements while they are still available and thus preserving responsiveness. In addition, the findings suggest some promise for first use of the universal vaccine in the elderly, if given with an enhanced regimen. Overall, the work helps define strategies to improve vaccine effectiveness in the elderly and thus has important public health implications.</p>
