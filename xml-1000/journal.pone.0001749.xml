In the last decade, nitric oxide (NO) emerged as a typical mitochondrial modulator by reversibly inhibiting citochrome oxidase and oxygen utilization.

We evoke a hyperinsulinemic-normoglycemic non-invasive clamp by subcutaneously injecting adult male rats with long-lasting human insulin glargine that remains stable in plasma by several hours. At a precise concentration, insulin increased phospho-Akt2 that translocates to mitochondria and determines <italic>in situ</italic> phosphorylation and substantial cooperative mtNOS activation (+4–8 fold, <italic>P</italic>&lt;.05), high NO, and a lowering of mitochondrial oxygen uptake and resting metabolic rate (−25 to −60%, <italic>P</italic>&lt;.05).

Critical reduction of respiration takes part as well in the mechanisms of prevalent illnesses; a reduction of mitochondrial activity and the decrease in energy expenditure contribute substantially to metabolic dysfunction in aging, insulin resistance and diabetes and conducts to lipid accumulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001749-Auwerx1">[3]</xref>. Of the many studies focused on insulin resistance and mitochondrial dysfunction in the last decade <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001749-Houstis1">[4]</xref>, few have critically examined mitochondrial activity in terms of alternation between complete substrate oxidation and storage as macromolecular deposits [glycogen or fat stores]. A mutual connection between decreased respiratory rate and the synthesis pathways was reported by Petersen <italic>et al</italic> who found that 40% reduction in mitochondrial oxidative and phosphorylation activity increased intramyocellular lipid content in elderly volunteers with severe muscle insulin resistance, compared with matched young control subjects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001749-Petersen1">[5]</xref>. Although lipid and glycogen accumulation further increases insulin resistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001749-Derave1">[6]</xref>, a clear mechanism for reduction of mitochondrial oxidations with displacement of substrates to storage was not defined in this context yet.</p><p>With high affinity for O<sub>2</sub>, cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase is responsible for the final transference of electrons to oxygen for reduction to water in mitochondria. In the last years, cumulative evidence shows that mitochondrial NO is a typical regulator that binds cytochrome oxidase at subunit II <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001749-Carreras1">[7]</xref>, competes with high-affinity for oxygen occupancy, and thus reversibly inhibits cytochrome oxidase and reduces respiration at nanomolar concentrations; at equal demands, physiologic <italic>in vivo</italic> oxygen utilization by mitochondria depends on the matrix NO/O<sub>2</sub> ratio <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001749-Poderoso1">[8]</xref>.</p><p>Although the diffusible NO yielded by cytosol nitric oxide synthase (NOS) isoforms modulates respiration <italic>in</italic> vivo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001749-Brown1">[9]</xref>, an advantage comes from the mitochondrial compartmentalization of NOS (mitochondrial nitric oxide synthase; mtNOS) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001749-Giulivi1">[10]</xref> that directs NO flux vectorially to the matrical space. In particular, neuronal nitric oxide synthase [nNOSα] binds complexes I <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001749-Franco1">[11]</xref> and IV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001749-Persichini1">[12]</xref> through specific domains; most of the mitochondrial NO yield is abolished by targeted disruption of the nNOSα gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001749-Kanai1">[13]</xref>. Likewise, activation of mtNOS and enhanced mitochondrial NO levels were previously demonstrated in normal rat development, hypothyroidism, cold acclimation, and hypoxia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001749-Peralta1">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001749-Zaobornyj1">[16]</xref>. At reduced mitochondrial respiratory activity, mtNOS modulation should therefore be equally important for insulin effects. Matrix NO reduces oxygen uptake and ATP levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001749-Brookes1">[17]</xref>, thereby increasing the level of reduced equivalents and acetyl-S-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA), the substrates for anaplerotic reactions and synthesis pathways stimulated by insulin. Moreover, in rat mitochondria, mtNOS is phosphorylated in an Akt-sensitive domain at Ser<bold><sup>1412</sup></bold>. The Akt/protein kinase B [PKB], a serine/threonine protein kinase with high homology for protein kinases A and C, was identified as the cellular homologue of the viral oncoprotein <italic>v</italic>-Akt (herein referred to as Akt). It is now clear that Akt1 and Akt2 have distinct functions, that both kinases are effectors of the insulin-PI3K pathway and that, Akt2 deficiency associates to a diabetes mellitus-like syndrome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001749-Cho1">[18]</xref>.</p><p>We therefore link here for the first time the mtNOS activity that results from nNOS confinement to muscle mitochondria with the respective rates of oxidative utilization of glucose or of glycogen synthesis induced by insulin. We postulate that insulin signaling activates Akt2, which not only activates the GLUT4 recycling pathway but also increases NOS activity in the organelles in an attempt to restrain mitochondria, thus favoring the replenishment of glycogen and fat energy stores. To that, we used a rat model of hyperinsulinemia with normal glycemia that allowed testing lasting effects of insulin on mitochondria. We succeeded in creating an <italic>in vivo</italic> comparative metabolic condition in which nNOS- and mtNOS-deficient muscles increase glucose and oxygen utilization and reciprocally restrict glycogen-synthesis providing molecular basis for understanding a NO-dependent progression of metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Insulin increases p-Akt2 in skeletal muscle mitochondria</title><p>Under fairly constant stimulation, insulin early increased the expression of Akt2 and phospho-Akt (p-Akt) in cytosol and mitochondria from skeletal muscle; thereafter, only mitochondrial Akt2 and p-Akt remained very high up to twelve hours after insulin (by about 4 and 6 folds, respectively). In contrast, insulin effects on Akt1 were poor and non-significant in the different fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001749-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Flow cytometry of the isolated and purified mitochondria confirmed a net increase of p-Akt fluorescence, with a similar temporal kinetics to that detected by western blotting.

To test p-Akt2 activity under these experimental conditions, we measured the activation of the natural target of Akt, glycogen synthase kinase (GSK-3α/β), to its phosphorylated form (p-GSK-3α/β).
