<abstract>
<p>The CCAAT/Enhancer Binding Proteins (C/EBPs) are a family of leucine-zipper transcription factors that regulate physiological processes such as energy metabolism, inflammation, cell cycle, and the development and differentiation of several tissues including skin. Recently, a role for C/EBPs in tumor cell proliferation and differentiation has been proposed, but the incomplete characterization in the literature of multiple translational isoforms of these proteins has made interpretation of these roles difficult. Therefore, we have carefully reexamined C/EBP isoform expression in human non-melanoma skin cancers. C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, and C/EBPδ were analyzed histologically in squamous cell carcinomas (SCC). The individual isoforms of C/EBPα and C/EBPβ were examined by immunofluorescent digital imaging, western blotting and DNA binding activity (electrophoretic mobility shift analysis). Expression of all C/EBP family proteins was decreased in SCC tumors. Suppression was greatest for C/EBPα, less for C/EBPβ, and least for C/EBPδ. Western analyses confirmed that C/EBPα p42 and p30 isoforms were decreased. For C/EBPβ, only the abundant full-length isoform (C/EBPβ−1, LAP*, 55 kD) was reduced, whereas the smaller isoforms, C/EBPβ−2 (LAP, 48 kD) and C/EBPβ−3 (LIP, 20 kD), which are predominantly nuclear, were significantly increased in well- and moderately-differentiated SCC (up to 14-fold for C/EBPβ−3). These elevations correlated with increases in PCNA, a marker of proliferation. Although C/EBPβ displayed increased post-translational modifications in SCC, phosphorylation of C/EBPβ−1 (Thr 235) was not altered. C/EBP-specific DNA binding activity in nuclear and whole-cell extracts of cultured cells and tumors was predominantly attributable to C/EBPβ. In summary, two short C/EBPβ isoforms, C/EBPβ−2 and C/EBPβ−3, represent strong candidate markers for epithelial skin malignancy, due to their preferential expression in carcinoma <italic>versus</italic> normal skin, and their strong correlation with tumor proliferation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>C/EBP transcription factors (C/EBPs), a family of six gene members in which C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, and C/EBPδ have been the most intensively studied, were originally identified as regulators of growth and differentiation in normal tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112073-Birkenmeier1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112073-Cao1">[3]</xref>. More recently, C/EBPs have received considerable attention as potential molecular markers that define prognostic risk in cancer; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112073-Johnson2">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112073-Zahnow1">[6]</xref>. C/EBPα is known to be a tumor suppressor in acute myelogenous leukemia [reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112073-Koschmieder1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112073-Pabst1">[8]</xref>], and is reportedly down-regulated in human epithelial cancers of the breast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112073-Gery1">[9]</xref>, lung <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112073-Halmos1">[10]</xref>, liver <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112073-Xu1">[11]</xref>, head and neck <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112073-Bennett1">[12]</xref>, endometrium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112073-Takai1">[13]</xref>, and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the skin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112073-Thompson1">[14]</xref>. C/EBPα expression levels in actinic keratoses and keratoacanthoma (precancerous skin conditions that can progress to SCC) were reduced relative to normal epidermis, and fully invasive SCCs expressed no detectable levels of C/EBPα, indicating a direct correlation between expression levels of C/EBPα and the severity of neoplasia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112073-Thompson1">[14]</xref>. C/EBPβ expression, in contrast to C/EBPα, was reportedly increased in advanced cases of breast, ovarian, colorectal, renal, and gastric carcinoma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112073-MildeLangosch1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112073-Sankpal1">[21]</xref>. However, interpretation of those reports is complicated by the existence of three different isoforms of C/EBPβ, a major topic of the current study (<italic>see below</italic>). C/EBPδ gene has been reported to be methylated in acute myelomoncytic leukemia (AML), cervical, breast and hepatocellular carcinoma and reduced expression associated with progression of breast tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112073-Balamurugan1">[22]</xref>. Other C/EBP family genes have received relatively less attention, but potential involvement of dysregulated C/EBPε <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112073-Verbeek1">[23]</xref>, and C/EBPζ/gadd153 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112073-Korabiowska1">[24]</xref> in leukemia and melanoma, respectively, has been suggested.</p>
<p>The question of whether absolute protein levels of the various C/EBPs reflect biological functions in human cancers remains unresolved, but it appears increasingly clear that changes in the ratio of C/EBP isoforms could have prognostic significance. C/EBPα and C/EBPβ are intronless genes, each producing a single mRNA transcript. Different protein isoforms can be produced from a single C/EBPα or C/EBβ transcript via a mechanism of alternative translation that uses different ATG start codons within the ribonucleotide sequence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112073-Calkhoven1">[25]</xref>. The human C/EBPα transcript produces two proteins, ∼42 kDa and ∼30 kDa, whereas the C/EBPβ transcript produces three proteins named LAP*, LAP, and LIP in mice, or C/EBPβ-1, C/EBPβ-2, and C/EBPβ-3 in humans, in order of decreasing size <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112073-Zahnow1">[6]</xref>. The shortest form can act as a dominant-negative inhibitor since it contains a DNA-binding region, yet lacks N-terminal amino acids necessary to transactivate gene transcription. For this reason, the relative expression levels of a long and short form, the “LAP/LIP ratio,” was proposed to participate in regulation of proliferation and differentiation in normal cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112073-Descombes1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112073-Dearth1">[27]</xref>, and in cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112073-Zahnow2">[28]</xref>. This idea now deserves a revisit as more detailed information has emerged. Linda Sealy et al. have established that the largest form of C/EBPβ observed in transformed breast cancer cell lines is C/EBPβ-2 (LAP), whereas the full-length C/EBPβ-1 (LAP*) is only expressed in whole tissues <italic>in vivo</italic> or in primary epithelial cells <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112073-Eaton1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112073-Bundy1">[30]</xref>. Also, elevated expression of C/EBPβ-2 in MCF10A normal human mammary epithelial cells results in transformation, an epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and acquisition of an invasive phenotype, directly linking C/EBPβ-2 to severity of neoplasia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112073-Bundy2">[31]</xref>. The implications here are two-fold: (i), current information about C/EBPβ-1 is not clear, given many older reports in which the analyses were performed immunohistologically and distinction between C/EBPβ-1 and C/EBPβ-2 was not recognized; (ii), previous interpretations regarding proteins extracted from tissues <italic>in vivo</italic> and detected by western blotting may need to be reconsidered, in light of newer information.</p>
<p>Murine models of cutaneous carcinogenesis may offer particular insight because recent reports have indicated important functional roles for C/EBPα and C/EBPβ during tumorigenesis in murine skin. Mice lacking C/EBPα in the epidermis show normal proliferation and differentiation but were highly susceptible to skin tumorigenesis in response to carcinogens. These mice displayed decreased tumor latency, increased tumor incidence, multiplicity, growth rate and malignant progression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112073-Thompson1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112073-Loomis1">[32]</xref>. Chemically induced squamous cell carcinomas and also primary cell lines established from these SCC, showed negligible expression of C/EBPα as compared with normal epidermis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112073-Shim1">[33]</xref>. Also, the expression levels of C/EBPα or C/EBPβ were a direct indicator of the state of neoplasia, since benign papillomas in mice showed an intermediate expression level, when compared to normal epidermis (highest level) and SCCs (lowest level) in the same study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112073-Oh1">[34]</xref>. C/EBPβ knockout mice are completely refractory to skin tumor development in response to chemical carcinogens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112073-Zhu1">[35]</xref> or UVB exposure [Anand <italic>et al</italic>., unpublished results]. A robust increase in apoptosis accompanied with elevated p53 levels in epidermis has been suggested as the causative mechanism for this resistance to tumor formation in C/EBPβ null mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112073-Yoon1">[36]</xref>. In a similar study, C/EBPδ KO mice showed no difference in the tumor phenotype as compared to wild type, in response to chemical carcinogen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112073-Sterneck1">[37]</xref>. However, in murine model of mammary tumerigenesis, loss of C/EBPδ resulted in increased mammary tumor multiplicity and reduced lung metastasis involving the regulation of HIF-1α, mTOR and FBXW7 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112073-Balamurugan1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112073-Balamurugan2">[38]</xref>. The role of C/EBPδ as an inflammatory response gene and also a candidate tumor suppressor gene has been supported by the sensitivity of C/EBPδ null mice to ionizing radiation-induced hematopoietic and intestinal injury <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112073-Pawar1">[39]</xref>.</p>
<p>In this paper, we have re-examined the question of change in histological expression of the three most abundant C/EBPs (α, β and δ) in human SCC, by looking comprehensively <italic>in vivo</italic> at expression of individual protein isoforms and their DNA-binding ability. Our data confirm an across-the-board downregulation of C/EBPα but more interestingly, the data show a strong upregulation of C/EBPβ-2 and C/EBPβ-3 that correlates with cellular proliferation in moderately- and well-differentiated SCC of the skin.</p>

<title>Collection of human tumor specimens</title>
<p>Discarded skin tissues, taken during Moh’s surgery for removal of SCC tumors diagnosed previously by biopsy, were obtained in a de-identified manner.

<title>Expression vectors, cell transfection and preparation of whole-cell and nuclear extracts</title>
<p>Expression vectors (pcDNA3.1) encoding rat C/EBPα and mouse C/EBPδ were kind gifts of David Ron (NYU Medical Ctr, New York, NY) and James Dewille (Ohio State University, Columbus, OH), respectively. An expression vector (pCMV6) encoding human C/EBPβ was purchased from Origene (Rockville, MD). An expression vector for human C/EBPβ1 (pcDNA3.1hisA) that exclusively expressed the longest form of C/EBPβ due to modification of the ATG for C/EBPβ2 was kindly provided by Linda Sealy (Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN). Nuclear extracts from <italic>cos-7</italic> cells overexpressing various C/EBPs (α, β and δ) were prepared exactly as described by Schreiber et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112073-Schreiber1">[44]</xref> following transfection of cells in 100 mm dishes using 3 µg of expression vector and GenePORTER reagent (Genlantis, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Whole cell extracts from cells overexpressing the C/EBPs were prepared by lysis in urea buffer (7 M urea, 2% IGEPAL, 5% β-mercaptoethanol and protease inhibitor cocktail), followed by 3–5 pulses (4–6 sec each) of sonication to disrupt membranes, and a 5 min high-speed microfuge spin to clear the lysates.

<title>Histological and immunofluorescent analysis of C/EBP expression in human tumors</title>
<p>Cryosections (5 µm) of frozen tumor samples were fixed 5 min in ice-cold methanol and stained with hematoxylin and eosin by standard methods. For immunohistochemical detection of C/EBPs, methanol-fixed cryosections were washed in PBS, and permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma, St Louis, MO) in PBS for 10 min on ice. Sections were serially incubated in the following solutions: 3% normal donkey serum, 30 min, room temperature (RT); primary antisera, overnight, 4°C; PBS rinses, 5 min x 3; Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA, 1∶1500, for 4 h at RT), PBS rinse x1; mounting in Vectashield (Vector Lab, Burlingame, CA) under coverslips. Antisera for C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, C/EBPδ, E-cad (all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and Ki67 (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA) were used at 1∶50 dilution in PBS.</p>

<title>Semiquantitative analysis of fluorescence intensity in immunostained sections of human skin tumors</title>
<p>Imaging of fluorescence intensity from immunostained skin specimens was standardized as follows. Seven different exposures of a given tumor specimen, and of a normal skin specimen from the same patient, was digitally captured on an Olympus BX50 fluorescent microscope (Olympus America, Center Valley, PA) equipped with a OolSNAP-Pro color CCD camera (Media Cybernetics, Bethesda, MD). Exposure times for each successive image were lengthened so as to double the amount of light collected. Pairs of digital images from tumor and normal hair follicle were compared side-by-side on a computer monitor, and the two images whose intensities were visually most closely matched were noted. From the ratio of exposure times of the best-matched image pair, the relative difference (fold) in C/EBP protein between tumor and normal was determined. For this analysis it was assumed that the fluorescent signal is directly proportional to the amount of C/EBP protein bound by primary antibody, since no amplification step was employed during immunostaining. Some examples of images analyzed in this way are illustrated in <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0112073.s002">Fig. S2</xref></bold>.</p>

<title>Western blot analyses</title>
<p>Cells were lysed and for human tumor samples, 30 µm cryosections (cut perpendicular to the skin surface) were scraped from the glass slide and pooled, then homogenized, lysed and sonicated in urea lysis buffer as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112073-Anand1">[42]</xref>. Protein content was determined by Bradford assay kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), and equal amounts were analyzed on western blots using 4–12% Bis-Tris acrylamide mini gels (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) or 10% Tris-Glycine gels, as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112073-Anand1">[42]</xref>.

<title>Expression of C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, and C/EBPδ is reduced in human cutaneous SCC</title>
<p>To obtain qualitative information about expression levels and intracellular localization of C/EBP transcription factors in skin cancers <italic>in vivo</italic>, we used primary antibodies to C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, and C/EBP<bold>δ</bold> to perform immunostaining on frozen SCC specimens and adjacent normal skin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112073-g001"><bold>Fig. 1</bold></xref>). Staining patterns for C/EBPα and C/EBPβ in normal epidermis, hair follicles, and sebaceous glands were consistent with previous reports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112073-Maytin1">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112073-Bull1">[48]</xref> i.e. C/EBPα and C/EBPβ staining was primarily cytoplasmic in the lower epidermal layers and hair follicle epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112073-g001"><bold>Fig. 1A</bold></xref>, “ep”), but became nuclear in the upper epidermal layers. The difference between C/EBPα and C/EBPβ was that greater amount of cytoplasmic C/EBPβ was also seen in the normal follicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112073-g001"><bold>Fig. 1A</bold></xref>). For C/EBPδ, expression was strongly nuclear throughout all layers of the epidermis (not shown) and in the follicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112073-g001"><bold>Fig. 1A</bold></xref>).</p>
<p>Within SCC tumor nests, the signal intensity for each C/EBP protein was markedly lower in tumor cells than in normal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112073-g001"><bold>Fig. 1A</bold></xref>), with some exceptions. To obtain more objective estimates of changes in C/EBP protein expression in the biopsy specimens, we devised an “f-stop” technique to quantify changes in the immunofluorescent signal in digitally-recorded micrographs; see Methods and <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0112073.s002">Fig. S2</xref></bold>. The graphs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112073-g001"><bold>Fig. 1B</bold></xref> summarize the results of this enhanced analysis for multiple SCC tumors; data for the individual tumors are in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0112073-t001"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>. For SCC, C/EBPα was suppressed in 7/8 specimens, C/EBPβ in 6/11 specimens, and C/EBPδ in 5/11 specimens. Thus, in terms of both frequency and magnitude of change in expression, C/EBPα was suppressed the most, C/EBPβ less so, and C/EBPδ the least.</p>

<title>Both C/EBPα isoforms and CEBPβ-1 isoform are decreased, whereas CEBPβ-2 and CEBPβ-3 are increased in malignant SCC cell lines</title>
<p>Because standard immunohistological technique can not differentiate between isoforms, we used western analysis to further refine our initial observations of C/EBP protein expression in SCC, focusing on C/EBPα and C/EBPβ. For a preliminary look, and to confirm the specificity of antibody reagents, we tested several cell lines that lie along a spectrum of increasingly malignant behavior. In the order of benign to malignant, the lines were: (i), NHEK, a normal human epidermal keratinocytes, (ii), HEK1, a virally transformed human keratinocyte line, (iii), SCC13, a spontaneously-tranformed squamous cell carcinoma line, and (iv), LNCAP, a prostate carcinoma line. In these cell lines, expression profiles of markers of growth-arrest and differentiation had already been established [see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0112073.s001">Fig. S1</xref> in ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112073-Anand1">[42]</xref>]. Here, western analyses revealed a decrease in both C/EBPα isoforms (42 kD and 30 kD) in parallel with the hierarchy of malignant progression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112073-g002"><bold>Fig. 2A, B</bold></xref>). This finding was consistent with clinical reports in breast carcinoma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112073-Gery1">[9]</xref>, human SCC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112073-Thompson1">[14]</xref> and experimental cutaneous carcinoma in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112073-Shim1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112073-Yoon2">[49]</xref>. For C/EBPβ, the situation was more complicated. Because previous literature did not always distinguish between the two large isoforms of C/EBPβ, we took care to confirm the identity of C/EBPβ-1 and C/EBPβ-2 on gels by comparing their location on the western blots with the location of recombinant proteins translated in cos-7 cells. For calibration purposes, we used: (i), a normal full-length human C/EBPβ sequence that expresses C/EBPβ-2 and −3 but not C/EBPβ-1 in the cos-7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112073-g002"><bold>Fig. 2C</bold></xref>, lanes 2 and 5), and (ii), a cDNA engineered to express only C/EBPβ-1 and not the other isoforms (lane 4). In the cell lines, the abundant C/EBPβ-1 isoform appeared to decrease with malignant progression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112073-g002"><bold>Fig.</bold> <bold>2C</bold></xref>, lanes 6–8), whereas the two smaller isoforms C/EBPβ-2 and C/EBPβ-3 were increased 2- to 5-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112073-g002"><bold>Fig.</bold> <bold>2D</bold></xref>). These results agree with others who reported that C/EBPβ-1 is expressed in normal mammary cells and tissues, but not expressed in immortalized cell lines. These data are also consistent with reports that high C/EBPβ-2 expression can results in transformation, EMT and acquisition of an invasive phenotype in normal human mammary epithelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112073-Eaton1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112073-Bundy2">[31]</xref>. We also tested for C/EBPδ, but signals on Western blots were too weak to assess. Low expression levels of C/EBPδ in these cell lines were later confirmed by functional DNA binding assays (see below).</p>

<title>In human SCC cancers, overall expression of C/EBPα and C/EBPβ is reduced, but expression of two small C/EBPβ isoforms is increased</title>
<p>We next examined human SCC specimens by western blotting. Obtaining sufficient tumor tissue from skin biopsies was only possible by pooling multiple thick frozen sections from the largest tumors, which comprised five invasive SCC. Those specimens were evaluated by two certified dermatopathologists to determine the histological tumor grade (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0112073.s001">Fig. S1</xref></bold>). Protein lysates from these tumors were loaded onto western blots in the order of worsening neoplasia, using duplicate blots to provide an estimate of variability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112073-g003"><bold>Fig. 3</bold></xref>). Three proteins (GAPDH, tubulin and actin) were used as housekeeping loading controls, instead of only one, because expression of “invariant” control genes often differs between skin samples as demonstrated by Minner and Poumay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112073-Minner1">[50]</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112073-g003"><bold>Fig. 3A</bold></xref> illustrates a typical Western blot for C/EBPα in normal and carcinoma tissues (only the actin control is shown). C/EBPα (p42) expression decreased by 60–75% in most of the SCCs, although less so in the most poorly differentiated tumor (S13). The C/EBPα p30 isoform was not detected.</p>
<p>For C/EBPβ, each isoform behaved differently. The largest protein, C/EBPβ-1, appeared as a thick multi-banded complex (55–70 kD), indicating a high level of post-translational modification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112073-g003"><bold>Fig. 3B</bold></xref>), as described by Zahnow <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112073-Zahnow1">[6]</xref>. The abundance of C/EBPβ-1 was moderately reduced in all SCC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112073-g003"><bold>Fig. 3D</bold></xref>), although a more remarkable loss of the highest MW (most post-translationally modified) forms of C/EBPβ-1 was absent in the well-to-moderately differentiated SCC tumors, S9–S11 <bold>(</bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112073-g003"><bold>Fig. 3B</bold></xref>, dotted oval). In contrast, the shorter isoforms, C/EBPβ-2 and β-3, were both strongly induced in tumors S9–S11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112073-g003"><bold>Fig. 3B</bold></xref>). Although expressed in low amounts, C/EBPβ-2 and C/EBPβ-3 differed qualitatively from C/EBPβ-1 in that both were undetectable in normal skin. By densitometry, C/EBPβ-2 and C/EBPβ-3 were increased in the well- and moderately-differentiated SCC, but not in the poorly-differentiated SCC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112073-g003"><bold>Fig. 3E</bold></xref>). C/EBPβ-3 appeared to offer the greatest signal-to-noise ratio, rising 8- to14-fold in the moderately-differentiated tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112073-g003"><bold>Fig. 3E</bold></xref>).</p>
</sec><sec id="s3d">
<title>The expression patterns of C/EBPβ-2 and C/EBPβ-3 in cutaneous SCC correlate with changes in markers of cellular proliferation and differentiation</title>
<p>To ask whether changes in the short C/EBP isoforms were correlated with any physiologic markers within tumors, markers of proliferation (PCNA) and differentiation (E-cadherin) were analyzed in the SCC by western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112073-g003"><bold>Fig. 3B</bold></xref>, bottom two panels). PCNA expression levels tracked very closely with expression of the smallest isoform, C/EBPβ-3, such that PCNA and C/EBPβ-3 were elevated in the same tumor subset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112073-g003"><bold>Fig. 3E and 3F</bold></xref>). E-cadherin did not bear any clear relationship with C/EBPβ expression. However, within SCC tumors as a group, E-cadherin expression rose as PCNA expression dropped (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112073-g003"><bold>Fig. 3F</bold></xref>), consistent with a permissive relationship between growth arrest and the onset of terminal differentiation often seen in squamous epithelia. Immunohistological analyses of proliferation (Ki67) and differentiation (E-cad) in SCC revealed a similar pattern as described above (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0112073.s003">Fig. S3</xref></bold>).</p>
</sec><sec id="s3e">
<title>The C/EBPβ-1 isoform is phosphorylated in SCC, but phosphorylation does not appear to be differentially regulated</title>
<p>To begin to examine post-translational modifications of C/EBPβ, we evaluated the phosphorylation state of C/EBPβ by probing blots with a selective antibody against C/EBPβ phosphorylated at threonine-235 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112073-g004"><bold>Fig. 4A</bold></xref>). Phosphorylation of the threonine 235 residue in human C/EBPβ by Ras-MAPK-ERK kinase (MEK) signaling pathway results in transcriptional activation of C/EBPβ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112073-Zahnow1">[6]</xref>. Here only one band corresponding to phosphorylated C/EBPβ-1/LAP*, was detected. However, up to four bands corresponding to various other forms of C/EBPβ-1 were apparent in the tumor specimens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112073-g004"><bold>Fig. 4B</bold></xref>). In normal skin, only one major form of C/EBPβ-1 was seen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112073-g004"><bold>Fig. 4B</bold></xref>, lanes 1 and 2) and it corresponded to phosphorylated C/EBPβ-1. Slower-migrating forms of C/EBPβ were observed in the SCC tumors and may correspond to acetylation, methylation, or sumoylation, as reported by others and summarized by Zahnow <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112073-Zahnow1">[6]</xref>. The ratio of phosphorylated C/EBPβ-1 to total C/EBPβ-1 (defined as those isoforms located above the dotted line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112073-g004"><bold>Fig. 4B</bold></xref>) did not change significantly in SCC relative to normal skin.</p>

<title>DNA-binding studies in SCC cell lines and tumor biopsies suggest a functional predominance of C/EBPβ, relative to C/EBPα or C/EBPδ</title>
<p>To determine which C/EBP isoforms in SCC are capable of binding to DNA targets, electrophoretic mobility shift analyses (EMSA) were performed. To validate the techniques, we first analyzed binding of recombinant C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, and C/EBPδ to a DNA oligonucleotide probe harboring a standard C/EBP consensus sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112073-g005"><bold>Fig. 5A</bold></xref>). Each of the three C/EBPs bound avidly to DNA, and the protein-DNA complexes were C/EBP site-specific (i.e., failed to bind to a mutant oligonucleotide), and C/EBP protein-specific (i.e., were supershifted by preincubation with anti-C/EBPα, anti-C/EBPβ, or anti-C/EBPδ antisera, respectively). Proteins extracted from the nuclei of SCC cell lines HEK-1 and SCC13 showed mainly C/EBPβ-specific binding, minor binding from C/EBPδ, and no binding from C/EBPα (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112073-g005"><bold>Fig. 5B</bold></xref>).</p>

<p>When studying DNA-binding proteins in whole tumors, one must use whole-tissue extracts rather than nuclear extracts because selective extraction of nuclear proteins is impossible (as cells are disrupted during frozen sectioning). To ask whether C/EBPβ expression profiles in whole cell extracts (WC) <italic>vs.</italic> nuclear extracts (NucX) would be similar or different, we compared WC to NucX prepared from normal keratinocytes or from HEK1 carcinoma cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112073-g005"><bold>Fig. 5C</bold></xref>). NucX contained C/EBPβ-2 and C/EBPβ-3 almost exclusively, whereas WC contained mostly C/EBPβ-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112073-g005"><bold>Fig. 5C</bold></xref>). When these two lysates were compared by EMSA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112073-g005"><bold>Fig. 5D</bold></xref>), the abundance of the protein-DNA complexes that formed [see bracket with a double asterisk] tended to reflect the size distribution of C/EBPβ isoforms in the extracts, i.e. larger complexes in WC than in NucX. However, the predominant C/EBP family member expressed was always C/EBPβ, regardless of whether WC or NucX was examined. We next did DNA binding studies on total tissue lysates from normal skin and tumor specimens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112073-g005"><bold>Fig. 5E</bold></xref>). C/EBPβ binding was easily detectable in all specimens. C/EBPδ was only weakly positive, and C/EBPα was absent. In summary, C/EBPβ appears to be the major C/EBP species present and capable of binding conventional C/EBP sites on DNA, both in normal skin and in SSC tumors.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Nonmelanoma skin cancers (NMSC), comprising basal cell carcinomas (BCC) and squamous cell carcinomas (SCC), constitute the most common of all human cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112073-Ridky1">[51]</xref>. SCCs, while representing only 10% of NMSC incidence, are very important because SCC can readily invade and metastasize. Thus an important research goal is to recognize features within tissue biopsies that might identify SCC cancers with the most aggressive biological behavior. In this manuscript, we have examined the expression of three members of the C/EBP transcription factor family that have gained attention as potential prognostic indicators in cancer. Our finding of decreased expression of C/EBPα in SCC concurs with previous reports implicating C/EBPα as a tumor suppressor in myeloid leukemia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112073-Pabst1">[8]</xref> and cutaneous SCC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112073-Thompson1">[14]</xref>, is consistent with suggestions that low C/EBPα expression in tumors contributes to failure of cell cycle arrest <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112073-Koschmieder1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112073-Gery1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112073-Halmos1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112073-Bennett1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112073-Shim1">[33]</xref>. For C/EBPβ our data agree with some findings, yet contradict other aspects of previous clinicopathological studies on C/EBPβ expression in malignancies of various origins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112073-MildeLangosch1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112073-Sundfeldt1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112073-Rask1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112073-Sankpal1">[21]</xref>. In agreement, we noted an overall increase in C/EBPβ expression in carcinoma cell lines and in SCC tumors <italic>in vivo</italic> relative to normal keratinocytes. However, these increases were entirely due to elevated amounts of the short isoforms, C/EBPβ−2 and C/EBPβ−3. The full-length isoform C/EBPβ−1 was actually slightly decreased. Because most previous studies were not clear about the exact identity of the large C/EBPβ isoforms being observed, it is not possible to know whether apparent discrepancies reflect differences between skin and other tissues, or instead reflect differences in methodologies for protein separation and detection. In the current study, two additional techniques were employed to validate our histological findings; namely, western blotting was calibrated by the use of recombinant C/EBPβ isoform standards, and EMSA was used to determine functional DNA binding capacity.</p>
<p>Changes in C/EBP expression observed on our western blots cannot be ascribed to differences in cell populations within different tissue specimens, because protein lysates were prepared from frozen biopsy sections with very similar cellular components by histological examination. Thus, in both the normal skin specimens and the SCC tumor sections, &gt;90% of the cells were epithelial (either hair follicles and epidermis, or squamous tumor cells; see (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0112073.s001">Fig. S1</xref></bold>). Given these equal proportions of normal and neoplastic epithelial cells, relative changes in C/EBPβ isoforms we observed most likely reflect changes in intracellular C/EBPβ expression, probably at the level of alternative mRNA translation (see Introduction). However, we cannot rule out a role for increased transcription of the C/EBPβ gene, since studies with cultured cells show that ER stress (from glucose deprivation or amino acid deprivation) can induce the expression of human C/EBPβ through unfolded protein response elements in the 3′-UTR of the gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112073-Chen1">[52]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112073-Thiaville1">[53]</xref>. We also cannot rule out the possibility that post-translational modification of C/EBPβ (via upstream signaling pathways) might affect protein stability and accumulation. Although changes in phosphorylation appeared to be relatively minor, other modifications to these proteins were apparent (see next paragraph).</p>
<p>Changes in differential expression of the C/EBPβ isoforms were among the most interesting findings. C/EBPβ-1 (or LAP*) constituted the vast majority of C/EBPβ expressed in the skin, both normal and SCC, a fact not previously appreciated. Phosphorylation of this isoform at threonine-235 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112073-Nakajima1">[54]</xref> was not significantly altered in SCC specimens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112073-g004"><bold>Fig. 4A</bold></xref>), suggesting that other modifications such as C/EBPβ acetylation, methylation, and sumoylation as reported in other systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112073-Zahnow1">[6]</xref> might account for shifted C/EBPβ-1 bands that were apparent in SCC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112073-g004"><bold>Fig. 4B</bold></xref>). A recent report by Atwood et al. reported sumoylation of C/EBPβ-1 in breast cancer cells as a possible mechanism to circumvent oncogene induced senescence (OIS) in tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112073-Atwood1">[55]</xref>. Overall, the changes in C/EBPβ-1 were not very impressive, with only a ∼50% decrease observed in the SCC along with modest decreases in post-translational modification (phosphorylation) in well and moderately differentiated SSC. In contrast, C/EBPβ-2 and C/EBPβ-3 (especially C/EBPβ-3) were highly induced in SSC relative to normal skin. Isoform levels correlated directly with levels of PCNA and therefore may reflect cell division within the tumors, either directly or indirectly. Overall, these findings suggest that C/EBPβ-2 and C/EBPβ-3 represent potential biomarkers of proliferative potential in cutaneous SCC.</p>
<p>From the literature, C/EBPβ appears to be involved in tumor cell proliferation through regulation of cyclin D1 and its target genes. Cyclin D1 is often overexpressed in cancers, driving the cell cycle inappropriately and preventing normal G1 arrest. C/EBPβ may be co-regulatory with cyclin D1, both directly and indirectly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112073-Eaton1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112073-Lamb1">[56]</xref>. In transient transfection studies, C/EBPβ-2 was capable of binding and activating the cyclin D1 gene promoter; which would tend to drive the cell cycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112073-Eaton1">[29]</xref>. Another mechanism may involve coregulation of a common set of target genes by C/EBPβ and cyclin D1, as shown by an elegant study in which more than 500 human tumor specimens were examined by gene expression profiling; the C/EBPβ gene was consistently coexpressed with the same set of genes activated by cyclin D1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112073-Lamb1">[56]</xref>. The promoters of seven of the cyclin D1-responsive genes that were examined in more detail contained classical C/EBPβ binding sites. However, those promoters were atypical; they were suppressed by wildtype C/EBPβ and activated by a dominant-negative mutant of C/EBPβ (functionally similar to LIP). Thus, C/EBPβ−1 and/or C/EBPβ−2 normally appear to repress cyclin D1 target genes, and cyclin D1 acts by antagonizing this repressor function. In tumors, high levels of dominant-negative C/EBPβ−3 could antagonize the repression of cyclin D1 target genes by displacing the long C/EBPβ isoforms, activating cell cycle progression.</p>
<p>Our <italic>in vivo</italic> data in tumors tend to support previous cell culture and animal experiments demonstrating that C/EBPβ−3 exerts preferential effects upon gene transcription that may favor cancer progression. Zahnow et al. created transgenic mice in which LIP (C/EBPβ-3) was targeted to the mammary gland, leading to hyperplasia and tumorigenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112073-Zahnow3">[57]</xref>. Human breast cancer cells lose their ability to undergo growth-arrest in response to TGFβ; Gomis et al. showed that forced overexpresion of LIP exacerbated this loss of TGFβ cytostatic response, whereas C/EBPβ-2 (LAP) overexpression restored the response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112073-Gomis1">[17]</xref>. Positive correlations between elevated levels of LIP and neoplastic transformation have been reported in murine mammary epithelial tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112073-Raught1">[16]</xref> and in human breast cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112073-Eaton1">[29]</xref>. Such results argue that a high LIP:LAP ratio is pro-oncogenic whereas a low LIP:LAP ratio favors normal differentiation. The mechanism of action most often quoted involves LIP as a dominant negative inhibitor. Because LIP binds DNA yet lacks a transactivation domain, LIP can displace other activating isoforms (such as LAP) from sites on DNA and block transcription of at least some target genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112073-Descombes1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112073-Zahnow3">[57]</xref>. However, such effects are gene-dependent since LIP actually activates certain genes in different cellular contexts, as reviewed by Zahnow <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112073-Zahnow1">[6]</xref>. Complexities and contradictions abound. For example, C/EBPβ-2 (LAP) when overexpressed at high levels using a retroviral vector, caused neoplastic transformation in human mammary epithelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112073-Bundy1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112073-Bundy2">[31]</xref>, and C/EBPβ-3 (LIP) did not cause transformation and in fact blocked proliferation in that system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112073-Bundy2">[31]</xref>.</p>
<p>C/EBPβ-3 is a relatively minor component when compared to C/EBPβ-1, which presents a puzzle when thinking about how C/EBPβ-3 manages to exert such profound effects during malignant transformation. However, our data suggest that C/EBPβ-3 and C/EBPβ-2 may reside in a different geographic and functional compartment than C/EBPβ-1. In whole-cell lysates of HEK1 cells and NHEK cells, C/EBPβ-1 is the major constituent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112073-g005"><bold>Fig. 5C</bold></xref>). Yet, C/EBPβ-1 is nearly absent in classical nuclear extracts (nuclear proteins extracted using high salt), where C/EBPβ-2 and C/EBPβ-3 are abundant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112073-g005"><bold>Fig. 5C</bold></xref>). Eaton et al. reported substantial C/EBPβ-1 as well as C/EBPβ-2 and C/EBPβ-3 in crude nuclear lysates of normal mammary epithelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112073-Eaton1">[29]</xref>. In that case, however, the C/EBPβ-1 may have been tightly bound to nuclear/perinuclear membranes or to chromatin, which were spun down in the nuclear pellet prior to collection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112073-Eaton1">[29]</xref>. The fact that immunostained C/EBPβ is consistently observed in cytoplasmic/perinuclear locations within basal keratinocytes of normal epidermis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112073-Maytin1">[47]</xref>, which contain little or no C/EBPβ-2 nor C/EBPβ-3, suggests that the abundant C/EBPβ-1 isoform resides preferentially in cytoplasmic/perinuclear membranes in those locations. In addition, our western data show that C/EBPβ-2 and C/EBPβ-3 exist in a more loosely bound state than C/EBPβ-1, being preferentially extractable in high salt buffer. C/EBPβ-2 and C/EBPβ-3 may even comprise a majority of the active, DNA-binding C/EBPs detected within SSC tumor lysates, since in the EMSA experiments there is a correlation between (i), expression levels of the individual proteins C/EBPβ-2 and C/EBPβ-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112073-g003"><bold>Fig. 3B</bold></xref>) and (ii), intensity of C/EBPβ-containing DNA/protein complexes in the EMSA experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112073-g005"><bold>Fig. 5E</bold></xref>); these two parameters are both high for SCC9 and SCC10, and low for SCC12 and SCC13.</p>
<p>The idea that C/EBPβ-1 and C/EBPβ-2 may have different functional roles is consistent with previous studies. C/EBPβ-1 and -2 were each capable of binding to the cyclin D1 promoter, yet only C/EBPβ-2 could activate a cyclin D1 promoter-reporter construct in human mammary epithelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112073-Eaton1">[29]</xref>. Many other studies showed that C/EBPβ-2 is a stronger transactivator than C/EBPβ-1; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112073-Zahnow1">[6]</xref>. Distinct functional and binding properties of C/EBPβ-1 may be attributable to the unique N-terminal region (21 amino acids of C/EBPβ-1), that can specifically bind the SWI-SNF nucleosome remodeling complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112073-KowenzLeutz1">[58]</xref>, and possibly other proteins as well <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112073-Zahnow1">[6]</xref>.</p>
<p>The potential clinical utility of C/EBPβ-2 and -3 isoforms, as biomarkers for cancer prognosis, will be difficult to evaluate until a more sensitive assay for C/EBPβ isoform detection in routine skin biopsy specimens is developed. Our data, however, suggest that such a developmental effort could be worthwhile. The high correlation between C/EBPβ-3 expression and tumor proliferation in SCC offers promise. On the other hand, very anaplastic tumors may lie so far along a pathway to neoplastic degeneration that normal mechanisms of squamous differentiation no longer apply. Thus, the poorly-differentiated tumors S12 and S13 showed no C/EBPβ-3 elevation, and showed very low proliferation levels.</p>
<p>In summary, we have demonstrated that levels of C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, and to a lesser extent C/EBPδ are decreased in human SSC. Observed losses of C/EBPα are in accord with the widely acknowledged tumor suppressor function of C/EBPα, now well-established in myeloid leukemia and in some solid tumors including SCCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112073-Johnson2">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112073-Koschmieder1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0112073-Schuster1">[59]</xref>. More novel is our finding that C/EBPβ-1 (the most abundant C/EBPβ isoform) is also reduced in skin carcinomas, a fact not previously recognized. Most interesting, however, is our demonstration of a robust and qualitative induction of C/EBPβ-3 which correlates with proliferative activity and could contribute to gene dysregulation in SSC tumors. Our analysis of DNA-binding activity suggests that C/EBPβ isoforms constitute most of the functional C/EBP family proteins in SCC. Combined with experimental evidence from other systems, these data further strengthen the possibility that C/EBPβ-3 (and maybe also C/EBPβ-2) are important players in aberrant gene regulation in carcinomas, and should be investigated as potentially useful markers of neoplastic progression in SCC. In other words, the short C/EBPβ proteins should be on the short list of future biomarker studies.</p>

<p><bold>Semiquantitative analysis of relative differences in immunofluorescence, using micrographs of normal skin and tumor tissue, captured as a continuous series of timed exposures.</bold> Imaging of fluorescence intensity was standardized as follows. Seven different exposures of a given tumor specimen, and a normal skin specimen from the same patient were digitally captured on an Olympus BX50 fluorescent microscope (Olympus America, Center Valley, PA) equipped with a CoolSNAP-Pro color CCD camera (Media Cybernetics, Bethesda, MD). Each exposure time in the series doubled the amount of collected light. Pairs of digital images from tumor and normal hair follicles were compared side-by-side on a computer monitor, and the two images with the most closely matched intensities were noted. The relative difference in C/EBP protein between tumor and normal was determined from these exposure times. This analysis assumes that fluorescent signal is directly proportional to C/EBP protein bound by primary antibody, since no amplification step was employed during immunostaining. Two examples of this analytic approach are shown below. For C/EBPα: The best match (equal intensities) is for the normal follicle at 2.0 s and tumor at 6.4 s. From the ratio of exposure times (2.0/6.4), the tumor is ∼0.3 the intensity of normal tissue, or ∼3-fold less intense than the normal hair follicle. For C/EBPβ: The best match is the normal follicle at 2.0 s and the tumor at 3.2 s. (Higher exposure times were in the saturation range, and therefore less reliable). From the ratio of exposure times (2.0/3.2), the tumor intensity is ∼0.63 or 63% of the normal tissue intensity, a reduction in intensity of approximately one-third. (Scale bar: 100 µm.)</p>
