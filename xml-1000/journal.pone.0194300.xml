<abstract>
<p>Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) has key roles in animal reproduction, including spermatogenesis and ovarian maturation. Many factors influence FSH secretion. However, despite the broad functions of microRNAs (miRNAs) via the regulation of target genes, little is known about their roles in FSH secretion. Our previous results suggested that miR-186-5p targets the 3′ UTR of <italic>FSHb</italic>; therefore, we examined whether miR-186-5p could regulate FSH secretion in rat anterior adenohypophyseal cells. miR-186-5p was transfected into rat anterior pituitary cells. The expression of <italic>FSHb</italic> and the secretion of FSH were examined by RT-qPCR and ELISA. A miR-186-5p mimic decreased the expression of <italic>FSHb</italic> compared with expression in the control group and decreased FSH secretion. In contrast, both the mRNA levels and secretion of FSH increased in response to miR-186-5p inhibitors. Our results demonstrate that miR-186-5p regulates FSH secretion by directly targeting the <italic>FSHb</italic> 3′ UTR, providing additional functional evidence for the importance of miRNAs in the regulation of animal reproduction.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>FSH, which is synthesized and secreted by the anterior pituitary gland, has important functions in both sexes in mammals. In males, FSH targets testis Sertoli cells to regulate spermatogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194300.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194300.ref002">2</xref>]. In females, FSH stimulates ovarian follicle growth and maturation and promotes granulosa cell proliferation and differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194300.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194300.ref003">3</xref>]. It is a heterodimeric glycoprotein composed of a common α subunit (α-GSU) and a unique β subunit (FSHb). FSH plays important roles in animal reproduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194300.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194300.ref005">5</xref>] and is regulated by many factors. For example, multiples studies have shown that FSH is affected by the level of GnRH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194300.ref006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194300.ref007">7</xref>]. In addition, Kiezun et al. showed that adiponectin plays a major role in FSH secretion during the estrous cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194300.ref008">8</xref>]. However, little is known about the regulation of FSH secretion at the post-transcriptional level.</p>
<p>A microRNA (miRNA) is an ~22 nucleotide, short, non-coding RNA molecule that functions as a post-transcriptional regulator of gene expression by suppressing transcription or degrading the protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194300.ref009">9</xref>]. miRNAs regulate gene expression in animals, plants, and viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194300.ref009">9</xref>]. There is increasing evidence for a role of miRNAs in hormone regulation. Hasuwa et al. indicated that miR-200b/miR-429 stimulates luteinizing hormone (LH) levels by targeting ZEB1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194300.ref010">10</xref>], and Nemoto et al. showed that miR-325-3p decreases LH secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194300.ref011">11</xref>]. Furthermore, miR-26b is involved in growth hormone (GH) regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194300.ref012">12</xref>] and miRNAs have been identified as regulators of gonadotropins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194300.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194300.ref014">14</xref>]. Zhang et al. indicated that miR-143 mediates the proliferative signaling pathway of FSH and further regulates estradiol production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194300.ref015">15</xref>]. However, the regulatory role of miRNAs in FSH secretion is unclear.</p>
<p>In this study, to verify the interaction between <italic>FSHb</italic> mRNA and miR-186-5p, we mutated the target sites of miR-186-5p in the <italic>FSHb</italic> 3′ UTR. To determine whether miR-186-5p regulates FSH secretion, we measured the mRNA expression levels of <italic>FSHb</italic> and the secretion of the FSH hormone after the transfection of miR-186-5p into primary rat pituitary cells.</p>

<title>Construction of the reporter plasmids</title>
<p>According to the genome sequence information for the rat <italic>FSHb</italic> 3′ UTR (GenBank Accession No. NM_001007597.2), PCR primers were designed to amplify the full length of the <italic>FSHb</italic> 3′ UTR. The forward primer was <monospace>GCGCTCGAGGGAACAATGGACATTGCC</monospace> and the reverse primer was <monospace>AATGCGGCCGCTTCATCAGTAGCACTTTTA</monospace>. The amplified fragment was cloned between the XhoI and NotI sites of the pmiR-RB-REPORT<sup>TM</sup> plasmid to construct the pmiR-FSHb-3′UTR-WT plasmid. Two target sites of miR-186-5p and the <italic>FSHb</italic> 3′ UTR were mutated, i.e., TTCTTTA to AAGAAAT and ATTCTTT to TAAGAAA, to obtain pmiR-FSHb-3′UTR-MUT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0194300.s001">S1 File</xref>).

<title>MiR-186-5p targets the 3′ UTR of <italic>FSHb</italic> mRNA</title>
<p>In our previous study, a luciferase reporter assay indicated that miR-186-5p mimics reduce luciferase activity by 32% compared with that of a negative control group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194300.ref016">16</xref>]. To further verify the interaction between miR-186-5p and <italic>FSHb</italic>, we predicted the target site of miR-186-5p in the <italic>FSHb</italic> 3′ UTR using TargetScan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0194300.g001">Fig 1A</xref>), and mutated the target site TTCTTTA to AAGAAAT and ATTCTTT to TAAGAAA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0194300.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Next, we constructed pmiR-FSHb-3′UTR-MUT and co-transfected miR-186-5p mimics and pmiR-FSHb-3′UTR-MUT into 293T cells. Co-transfection of miR-186-5p mimics and pmiR-FSHb-3′UTR-WT into 293T cells led to a greater than 40% reduction in luciferase activity; moreover, when the miR-186-5p binding site of the <italic>FSHb</italic> 3′ UTR was replaced with a mutant sequence (pmiR-FSHb-3′UTR-MUT), there was an increase in luciferase activity compared with that of the control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0194300.g001">Fig 1C</xref>).

<title>Detection of differential miR-186-5p expression at various developmental stages in the pituitary and in other rat tissues</title>
<p>We detected miR-186-5p expression in 2-week- and 4-month-old rats to examine expression differences among developmental stages in the rat pituitary. We detected miR-186-5p expression in both stages, and we found that compared with levels in the non-sexual maturity period, miR-186-5p was down-regulated in the sexual maturity period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0194300.g002">Fig 2A</xref>).

<title>Effect of miR-186-5p transfection into rat primary pituitary cells</title>
<p>For quality control, we used flow cytometry to detect rat anterior pituitary cell apoptosis after transfection with 100 nM miR-186-5p negative control, inhibitor negative control, mimic, and inhibitor for 24 h. We did not detect significant differences among the negative control groups and transfection groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0194300.g003">Fig 3A–3D</xref>). We then examined the expression of miR-186-5p after transfecting cells with 100 nM miR-186-5p negative control, inhibitor negative control, mimic, and inhibitor.

<title><italic>FSHb</italic> expression and FSH secretion after the overexpression or inhibition of miR-186-5p</title>
<p>We further verified the interaction between miR-186-5p and <italic>FSHb</italic> in rat anterior pituitary cells and examined the role of this interaction in the regulation of animal reproduction. Specifically, rat primary pituitary cells were transfected using 100 nM negative control (NC), miR-186-5p mimic, inhibitor negative control (I-NC), and miR-186-5p inhibitor; after 24 h, the level of <italic>FSHb</italic> was examined by quantitative RT-PCR. <italic>FSHb</italic> mRNA levels decreased significantly (0.66-fold, p &lt; 0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0194300.g004">Fig 4A</xref>) after the overexpression of miR-186-5p compared with the levels in the NC group. <italic>FSHb</italic> expression levels were significantly higher in the miR-186-5p inhibitor group than in the I-NC group (1.29-fold, p &lt; 0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0194300.g004">Fig 4A</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Analyzing changes in the relative luciferase activity of a reporter gene after co-transfection of a candidate miRNA with a mutant reporter gene vector is an important strategy to understand interactions between miRNAs and target genes. In some cases, mutations in miRNAs and target sites in genes do not affect luciferase activity compared with co-transfection with a reporter construct containing a wild-type 3′ UTR for the target gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194300.ref016">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194300.ref018">18</xref>]. However, in our study, when we co-transfected miR-186-5p mimics and pmiR-FSHb-3′UTR-WT into 293T cells, the luciferase activity was reduced by more than 40%; after mutating two target sites, luciferase activity was slightly higher, but still significantly different from wild-type levels. Interestingly, in 2014, Fu et al. reported that let-7a, miR-9, and miR-129-5p each had two target sites in <italic>FOXP2</italic>, and three mutant luciferase reporter constructs with mutations in one or two target sites were made. When only one binding site was mutated, luciferase activity was repressed by miRNAs, while mutations in both target sites led to the abolishment of regulatory effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194300.ref019">19</xref>]. Our results indicated that there are additional target sites that were not predicted using TargetScan. However, the increase in luciferase activity indicated that the predicted target sites were correct and miR-186-5p and <italic>FSHb</italic> had a direct interaction.</p>
<p>miRNAs act as regulators in many biological processes, including developmental timing, cell death, cell proliferation, and hematopoiesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194300.ref020">20</xref>]. miRNAs function in a tissue-specific and time-dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194300.ref021">21</xref>]. They have effects in the pituitary, a critical endocrine organ. In pituitary adenomas, increasing studies have provided evidence for the roles of miRNAs in various cellular processes; they have pathobiological significance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194300.ref022">22</xref>]. For example, miR-145 and miR-15a are down-regulated in GH and pituitary adenomas, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194300.ref023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194300.ref024">24</xref>]. Gentilin et al. found that miR-26a could directly target PRKCD and is involved in cell cycle regulation in ACTH-secreting pituitary adenomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194300.ref025">25</xref>]. They indicated that miRNA-mediated regulation has complex cellular outcomes and miRNAs can also mediate the regulation of cell cycle, cell growth, and apoptosis pathways. Furthermore, miRNAs also have a regulatory role in the normal pituitary. For instance, miR-26b is involved in the development of the pituitary in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194300.ref012">12</xref>]. In 2013, Zhang et al. found that miR-7 might function in the pituitary in pigs, thereby influencing body growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194300.ref026">26</xref>]. miRNAs can also regulate hormone secretion. For example, miR-325-3p is associated with the immobilization-induced suppression of LH secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194300.ref011">11</xref>], and miR-375 is involved in ATCH secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194300.ref027">27</xref>]. In our previous study, miR-186-5p expression was significantly differentially expressed (0.45-fold difference) between the non-sexual maturity developmental stage and the sexual maturity developmental stage in the rat pituitary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194300.ref016">16</xref>]. Accordingly, miR-186-5p is a potential regulator of pituitary development and reproduction.</p>
<p>Most miRNAs are expressed in a highly tissue-specific manner in the late stages of division, but not in early development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194300.ref021">21</xref>]. According to previous studies, miR-1 is highly expressed in the heart, but not in the brain or liver in human adults and mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194300.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194300.ref029">29</xref>]. In 2014, miR-1, miR-133a, miR-133b, and miR-206 were validated as muscle-specific miRNAs in rat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194300.ref030">30</xref>]. In 2015, Alessandro et al. identified 10 novel and 4 known heart-specific miRNAs in the left ventricle in sheep [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194300.ref031">31</xref>]. Moreover, in our study, miR-186-5p exhibited different degrees of expression in the rat heart, pituitary, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, and brain. Its expression tended to be high in the kidney and brain, but low in the pituitary and liver. Although miR-186-5p was not a tissue-specific miRNA in these rat tissues, its differential expression suggests that it is a candidate for further research.</p>
<p>The miRNA miR-186-5p is an important tumor suppressor and has been observed in many types of human cancers, including gastric cancer, hepatocellular cancer, and glioblastoma multiforme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194300.ref032">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194300.ref034">34</xref>]. In 2016, Huang et al. indicated that miR-186 suppresses cell proliferation and metastasis by targeting MAP3K2 in non-small cell lung cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194300.ref035">35</xref>]. In addition, in nonmelanoma skin cancer, miR-186-5p could be a novel noninvasive biomarker for detection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194300.ref036">36</xref>]. Thananya et al. showed that miR-186-5p might be a specific hepatic miRNA that responds to hepatitis B virus and predicts the response to pegylated-interferon alpha-2a [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194300.ref037">37</xref>]. When E6/E7 is silenced, miR-186-5p is down-regulated in HPV18-positive HeLa cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194300.ref038">38</xref>]. These studies demonstrated that miR-186-5p acts as an anti-oncogenic marker and is involved in the control of cell proliferation, senescence, and apoptosis. Despite a number of studies indicating that miR-186-5p is associated with human cancers, its role in hormone secretion is unclear. Our results showed that the overexpression of miR-186-5p down-regulates <italic>FSHb</italic> expression and decreases FSH secretion in rat anterior pituitary cells, providing evidence that hormone secretion in the pituitary is regulated by miRNAs.</p>
<p>FSH, as a pituitary hormone, is critical for the regulation of reproduction in mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194300.ref039">39</xref>]. Therefore, it is essential to determine the mechanism and timing of FSH regulation. Many factors determine <italic>FSHb</italic> expression and FSH secretion, including hormones, follistatin, and single nucleotide polymorphisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194300.ref040">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194300.ref042">42</xref>]. A novel single nucleotide polymorphism influences the FSH beta-subunit and the quality and fertility of bull semen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194300.ref043">43</xref>]. Additionally, a cis-regulatory element influences FSHb expression levels in bovine cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194300.ref044">44</xref>]. FSH secretion is strongly associated with GnRH, bio-available activin, and steroid hormones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194300.ref045">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194300.ref047">47</xref>]. However, few studies have reported a role of miRNAs in the regulation of FSH secretion. In 2015, Lannes et al. reported that the miR-132/212 pathway is associated with the stimulation of FSH secretion by GnRH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194300.ref048">48</xref>]. Ye et al. identified 10 up-regulated and 3 down-regulated miRNAs that are likely to directly target the porcine <italic>FSHb</italic> 3′ UTR after GnRH treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194300.ref049">49</xref>]. In 2016, miR-361-3p was found to regulate FSH by directly interacting with <italic>FSHb</italic> in porcine anterior pituitary cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194300.ref004">4</xref>]. Furthermore, we previously found that miR-21-3p and miR-433 both decrease FSH secretion by regulating FSHb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0194300.ref016">16</xref>]. In this study, the overexpression of miR-186-5p inhibited FSH secretion. Our results provide additional evidence for the regulatory role of miRNAs in FSH secretion.</p>
<p>Taken together, our results showed that miR-186-5p down-regulates the expression of <italic>FSHb</italic> and inhibits the secretion of FSH. These findings provide additional support for the regulatory functions of miRNAs in reproduction.</p>
