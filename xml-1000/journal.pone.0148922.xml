<abstract>
<p><italic>Octopus maya</italic> is a major socio-economic resource from the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico. In this study we report for the first time the chemical composition of the saliva of <italic>O</italic>. <italic>maya</italic> and its effect on natural prey, i.e. the blue crab (<italic>Callinectes sapidus</italic>), the crown conch snail (<italic>Melongena corona bispinosa</italic>), as well as conspecifics. Salivary posterior glands were collected from octopus caught by local fishers and extracted with water; this extract paralyzed and predigested crabs when it was injected into the third pereiopod. The water extract was fractionated by membrane ultrafiltration with a molecular weight cut-off of 3kDa leading to a metabolic phase (&gt;3kDa) and a neurotoxic fraction (&lt;3kDa). The neurotoxic fraction injected in the crabs caused paralysis and postural changes. Crabs recovered to their initial condition within two hours, which suggests that the effects of the neurotoxic fraction were reversible. The neurotoxic fraction was also active on <italic>O</italic>. <italic>maya</italic> conspecifics, partly paralyzing and sedating them; this suggests that octopus saliva might be used among conspecifics for defense and for reduction of competition. Bioguided separation of the neurotoxic fraction by chromatography led to a paralysis fraction and a relaxing fraction. The paralyzing activity of the saliva was exerted by amino acids, while the relaxing activity was due to the presence of serotonin. Prey-handling studies revealed that <italic>O</italic>. <italic>maya</italic> punctures the eye or arthrodial membrane when predating blue crabs and uses the radula to bore through crown conch shells; these differing strategies may help <italic>O</italic>. <italic>maya</italic> to reduce the time needed to handle its prey.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The Mexican red octopus, <italic>Octopus maya</italic>, is a large endemic species of the Yucatan Peninsula where it is of social and economic importance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148922.ref001">1</xref>]. It occurs mainly in shallow waters near the shore between 2 and 25 m depth along the continental shelf of the Yucatan Peninsula. <italic>Octopus maya</italic> is one of the most promising octopus species for aquaculture because holobenthic hatchlings become benthic juveniles only 7 to 10 days after hatching [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148922.ref002">2</xref>]. Considerable advances have occurred during the short history of <italic>O</italic>. <italic>maya</italic> aquaculture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148922.ref003">3</xref>]; for instance, new outdoor tanks have been designed, as well as a successful diet that allows animals to reach 250 g of body weight within 120 days post hatching [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148922.ref002">2</xref>].</p>
<p>Recent studies have demonstrated that octopuses are voracious and active carnivores; they have a complex feeding behavior which depends on their victim, from the detection to the consumption of prey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148922.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148922.ref005">5</xref>]. Octopods feed on a variety of benthic prey that includes crustaceans, gastropods, bivalves, fishes, and birds, although many species prefer decapod crustaceans such as crabs, and some bivalves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148922.ref005">5</xref>]. However, defensive structures of crabs such as sharp chelae represent a problem for the predator. Therefore, octopuses need a strategy to avoid body damage from cutting chelae during handling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148922.ref006">6</xref>]. A cautious handling behavior has been described in some species of cephalopods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148922.ref007">7</xref>] but it has not been studied in <italic>O</italic>. <italic>maya</italic> when feeding on various types of prey such as gastropods and crustaceans. The calcareous surface and chitinous exoskeleton of gastropods and crustaceans respectively protect them against predator attacks and are likely to represent difficulties for octopuses. Foraging studies have shown that octopods envelop their prey with their arms and web; the prey is strongly held by the circumoral suckers of the octopus and then carried to the mouth. At this point, the octopus injects saliva from the posterior salivary glands (PSGs) into the prey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148922.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148922.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148922.ref008">8</xref>]. However, the mechanism by which <italic>O</italic>. <italic>maya</italic> subdues and kills its prey remains unclear. To date, studies of prey handling behavior in octopods have revealed some of the mechanisms by which octopuses introduce saliva into their prey. These mechanisms include hole-boring or drilling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148922.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148922.ref010">10</xref>] and eye puncture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148922.ref011">11</xref>], although arthrodial membrane puncture has also been suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148922.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148922.ref012">12</xref>]. The site of injection of the saliva also appears to be influenced by both prey and octopus size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148922.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148922.ref004">4</xref>]. However, the mechanism used by <italic>O</italic>. <italic>maya</italic> to handle its prey remains unexplained. A study of predatory events and handling strategies developed by <italic>O</italic>. <italic>maya</italic> may help in the design of artificial baits for the fishery and for aquaculture.</p>
<p>Saliva is a venomous fluid created in the octopus PSG and it can be used for the acquisition of food, for defense and to reduce competition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148922.ref013">13</xref>]. The saliva of octopuses has two major functions: paralysis and pre-digestion of prey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148922.ref014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148922.ref016">16</xref>]. It consists of biogenic amines (serotonin, octopamine, and tryptamine), neuropeptides (tachykinins) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148922.ref017">17</xref>] and some metabolic enzymes, e.g. trypsin, chymotrypsin, and chitinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148922.ref018">18</xref>]. Molecular studies have also revealed the presence of chitinase, peptidase S1, antigen 5, pathogenesis-related peptide (PR-1), phospholipase A2 (PLA2), and six novel types of peptides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148922.ref019">19</xref>]. The pre-digestive function of the saliva is due to the metabolic enzymes that allow the detachment of exoskeletal tissue and thereby facilitate the extraction of muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148922.ref011">11</xref>]. The paralyzing activity of saliva was first attributed to tyramine (4-hydroxyphenethylamine) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148922.ref020">20</xref>] and recently to α- and β-cephalotoxins, two potent glycoproteins (91.2 and 33.9 kDa MW, respectively) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148922.ref021">21</xref>]. Venoms of cephalopods, including octopuses, share similar biochemical compositions, suggesting a shared ancestry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148922.ref019">19</xref>].</p>
<p>Cannibalism is common in octopods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148922.ref022">22</xref>], e.g. more than 10% of <italic>O</italic>. <italic>maorum</italic> and <italic>O</italic>. <italic>tehuelchus</italic> diets result from cannibalism. Cannibalistic behavior in octopuses might be related to their high protein demand, voracious feeding, high density and the lack of social behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148922.ref023">23</xref>]. Cannibalism is also important in octopods since cephalopods have limited energy storage. In case of food depletion, octopods can adjust to environmental conditions by reducing their numbers. Additionally, octopus can kill conspecifics by strangulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148922.ref024">24</xref>] or presumably by biting individuals, which may result in venom injection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148922.ref025">25</xref>], although the latter killing technique has not been examined. <italic>Octopus maya</italic> has also shown cannibalism when reared in aquaria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148922.ref002">2</xref>], but there are no detailed records on such behavior.</p>
<p>The aims of this study are: 1) to determine the chemical substances that <italic>O</italic>. <italic>maya</italic> uses in the predation of blue crabs and to apply those substances on conspecifics to demonstrate the biochemical mechanism of cannibalism; and 2) to describe the context in which saliva is normally used when octopuses feed on crabs of different sizes, and to identify the main site of injection. We separated saliva into metabolic and reversible neurotoxic fractions, both toxic to their prey and to conspecifics. The paralyzing effect of saliva on blue crabs was caused by amino acids, while a relaxing activity was induced by serotonin in both crabs and <italic>O</italic>. <italic>maya</italic> subadults. We have also demonstrated for the first time that saliva in octopods might be used for defense and for competition against other predators.</p>

<title>Ethics Statement</title>
<p>This study followed the Guide for the Care and Use of Cephalopods in Research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148922.ref026">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148922.ref027">27</xref>] and our protocols were approved by the Experimental Animal Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Chemistry at Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (Permit Number: Oficio/FQ/CICUAL/099/15).</p>
<p>Animals were anesthetized in cold sea water (2°C) under hyper-oxygenation as recommended for tropical cephalopod species. All efforts were made to minimize stress of the animals; a minimum number of animals were killed by an incision between the eyes.</p>

<sec id="sec004">
<title>Collection and Maintenance of Experimental Animals</title>
<p>Octopus were collected from Sisal harbor (20°51’20.26”N and 90°1’49.38”W, 21°13’59.42”N and 89°53’22.52”W) by traditional fishing methods called "jimba y gareteo" where fishermen attach on each side of the ship a 5 m bamboo stick tied to a rope with a weight of steel and with crab as bait. Live octopus are caught and pulled up on board, where juvenile octopus can be returned to the sea without damage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0148922.s008">S1 video</xref>).</p>
<p>In total, 100 octopus were captured during four collection trips and placed in a 200-L tank with seawater, changing the seawater every hour until arrival at the dock. In the laboratory, animals were individually placed in 80-L tanks with constant aeration and a flow-through seawater system under the following conditions: water temperature 24.65–29.23°C, salinity 35.71–35.72‰, dissolved oxygen 4.93–5.23 mg/L, and pH 7.61–7.79. Body mass was used as a criterion to define two octopus size categories: ‘small’ (≤ 450 g) and ‘large’ (≥ 450 g), representing subadult and adult stages respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148922.ref028">28</xref>]. Total weight (g) was measured with a balance scale. Octopus were collected five days before trials commenced, with three days for acclimation and two days for fasting.</p>
<p>Blue crabs (<italic>Callinectes sapidus</italic>) were selected as target prey owing to a greater selectivity of the octopus towards crustaceans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148922.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148922.ref014">14</xref>]. In total, 150 crabs were randomly collected from the soft bottom of the intertidal shallow shores of Sisal. The carapace width (CW) was measured to include the lateral spines and it was used to arbitrarily classify crabs by size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148922.ref028">28</xref>]. Crabs with &lt; 12 cm CW were classified as small, and crabs with &gt; 12 cm CW as large. The crabs were placed in a 200-L tank with aeration and a flow-through seawater system. The surface of the carapace of the crabs was examined for any damage; crabs in good condition were then numbered and individually placed in 100-L tanks with aeration and a flow-through seawater system.</p>
<p>Thirty crown conch snails (<italic>Melongena corona bispinosa</italic>) were collected from the Sisal coast and placed in a 100-L tank with aeration and a flow-through seawater system. Each individual was assigned a number; each shell was examined with a stereoscopic microscope, and imperfections or damage were recorded. All snails were maintained in a 200-L tank with aeration and a flow-through seawater system.</p>

<title>Behavior of <italic>Octopus maya</italic> fed with Callinectes sapidus</title>
<p>The interaction between large or small octopus and large or small blue crabs was examined to characterize the feeding behavior of <italic>O</italic>. <italic>maya</italic> and to determine whether prey handling differed according to predator and prey sizes. This approach resulted in four different predator-prey combinations: Large octopus-Large blue crab, Large octopus-Small blue crab, Small octopus-Large blue crab, Small octopus-Small blue crab, with 25 independent replicates each.</p>
<p>Prior to the experiments, octopus were offered fresh crab meat <italic>ad libitum</italic> and were then deprived for 48 h in order to standardize starvation levels. On the third day, an individual <italic>O</italic>. <italic>maya</italic> was placed in a circular fiberglass arena of 2.5 m in diameter, 60 cm deep, and with a tempered glass bottom (10-mm thick), under which a recording video-camera was situated. A second video-camera was located above the arena to obtain a full view of each foraging bout from two opposite angles. Seawater was introduced into the arena by means of a water pump and changed on a daily basis. Salinity, dissolved oxygen and temperature were set as per the maintenance conditions. Octopus were allowed 10 min to habituate to the arena before an individual crab was introduced, with the crab placed as far as possible from the octopus. Recordings lasted 8 min, a period of time that proved to be sufficient for a prey to be attacked and captured. Immediately after the recording ended, the prey was removed and kept frozen at -70°C for subsequent analysis.</p>
<p>A stereoscopic microscope (Leica, EZ4, HD) was used to examine whether the cephalothorax, eyes and joints of all walking appendages of the manipulated prey had signs of drilling. Depending on the place where the injury was found, prey individuals were classified by the presence of injuries in the eye, arthrodial membrane of any appendage or as items without evidence of drilling.</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>The presence/absence of the behaviors displayed by <italic>O</italic>. <italic>maya</italic> in the different treatments was analyzed by Non-Metric Dimensional Scaling (NMDS). The reciprocal of the Sorensen index (S<sub>8</sub>) was used as a dissimilarity measure between samples to compare the presence/absence of behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148922.ref032">32</xref>] used by predators of different size on prey of different size and amongst prey with different types of injuries. A 3D configuration was defined prior to the iterative procedure of NMDS and the magnitude of the stress was used as quality criterion for the final configuration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148922.ref032">32</xref>].

The underlying experimental design was a three-factor model with “prey size” (two levels: Small and Large), “predator size” (two levels: Small and Large) and “type of injury” (three levels: eye, arthrodial membrane, no evidence of drilling) as the main factors. Only the three main terms were considered relevant, hence they were statistically analyzed.

<p>Yield of crude extract was higher than expected given that the octopus generates saliva <italic>in situ</italic> but PSG tissue was extracted with water; hence salts, carbohydrates and proteins were also extracted and may have been present in the saliva.

Postural changes and time effects are dose dependent, e.g. low doses of serotonin (0.5 to 1.0 mg) induce rigid flexion of legs and abdomen for 10 to 30 min in the crayfish <italic>Procambarus clarkii</italic>, whereas extreme flexion that lasts several hours is observed if larger doses (1.0 to 10 mg) are injected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148922.ref042">42</xref>]. Moreover, some postural changes are conspicuous (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0148922.s005">S5 Fig</xref>) as previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148922.ref043">43</xref>], for instance, the “cradle carry” position exhibited by blue crab males during mating.</p>

<title>Saliva <italic>in vivo</italic></title>
<p>The presence of amino acids in the crude extract remained unclear because the fraction was obtained by water extraction with dead tissue, and the degradation and the autolysis of dead tissue may have produced free amino acids. The volume of saliva that <italic>O</italic>. <italic>maya</italic> uses to subdue its prey was determined, and the HPLC profile and yield were compared with the PSG extract from the fishery byproduct.</p>
<p>Early attempts to obtain saliva by an envenomation technique [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148922.ref044">44</xref>] were unsuccessful because of the elusive nature of <italic>O</italic>. <italic>maya</italic>. However, envenomation worked well with aggressive octopus such as <italic>Eledone</italic> spp. Saliva was collected from a live <italic>O</italic>. <italic>maya</italic> that was dissected less than 1 minute after sedation. The PSG and common conduct were stimulated with a 9 mV battery to obtain the saliva <italic>in vivo</italic> (less than 10 min passed from the dissection to the collection of the saliva). <italic>In vivo</italic> saliva was separated according to the PSG scheme; results are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0148922.t001">Table 1</xref>.</p>
<p>The fractions obtained presented nearly the same bioactivity in the neurotoxic bioassay.

<list list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Frontal—The octopus confronted the crab by facing its chelae, which were held, immobilized and forced to a ventral position with respect to the buccal mass of the octopus. The octopus appeared to use this technique to minimize damage, since chelae of the crab remained near and might have caused injury to the predator; only large <italic>O</italic>. <italic>maya</italic> presented this strategy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0148922.s012">S5 video</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Posterior—This consisted of an ambush attack where the predator was out of reach of the prey chelae. In addition, the octopus remained out of the visual field of the crab, which prevented the crab from taking evasive action. Both large and small octopus used this strategy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0148922.s013">S6 video</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Lateral—The octopus attacked the prey from the side. This allowed the predator to occupy a larger flank to attack the prey, whose position was no longer important. The octopus opted for this strategy especially when the crab was small or when the crab chelae were large (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0148922.s014">S7 video</xref>).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Overall, crabs were detected by octopus upon movement (Mov, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0148922.t002">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0148922.s006">S1 Table</xref>); only 0.04% of crabs were motionless when detected by the octopus. This indicates that visual cues from the prey were the most important for detection. This agrees with other reports that some cephalopods are visual hunters guided by the movements of their prey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148922.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148922.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148922.ref045">45</xref>]. Following detection of the prey, 75% of the octopus changed color (Detco; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0148922.t002">Table 2</xref>) and almost half did so to mimic the background of the arena (Detmi; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0148922.t002">Table 2</xref>). Similar results have been previously reported in octopods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148922.ref045">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148922.ref046">46</xref>]; the changes in color during foraging might be advantageous, particularly when corporal patterns can make them imperceptible. The octopus attacked either by ambush (46%) or by fast movements in pursuit of the crab (54%), with the predator either facing the prey with the first two arms extended forward or approaching the prey sideways (Ataq, PosP, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0148922.t002">Table 2</xref>). In 35% of trials, blue crabs received octopus attacks with both chelae spread apart, open in a clear defense position; since the prey was completely immobilized by octopus in only 27% of all foraging bouts, this defense position might give crabs an advantage. In all other trials, crabs were still capable of slightly moving the walking appendages and chelae, thereby retaining the ability to inflict damage to the octopus arms. Once crabs were captured, they were drawn towards the underside of the octopus from the front, from the rear, or sideways (Col1, Col2, Col3; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0148922.t002">Table 2</xref>). From the moment crabs were entirely enveloped by the web, crabs were left with both chelae completely unharmed. In at least 33% of the tests, the octopus moved to another place in the arena carrying the recently captured prey. This behavior suggests that in its natural environment the octopus seeks shelter in its den immediately after capturing a prey.</p>
<p>All the foraging bouts (n = 100) ended with the successful capture of crabs irrespective of crab and octopus size. However, none of these bouts showed evidence of drilling on the crab carapace. Whilst eight crabs were overcome by puncturing the orbital eye (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0148922.g004">Fig 4</xref>), 22 crabs were overcome by puncturing the arthrodial membrane of the last pair of walking pereiopods. Unfortunately, it was not possible to determine whether the damage was inflicted by the radula or the beak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0148922.g005">Fig 5</xref>). No evidence of perforations was found in the remaining 70 crabs captured. The lack of drilling on the carapace raises questions regarding the role of the radula when <italic>O</italic>. <italic>maya</italic> predates on crabs.</p>

<p>Octopus feeding strategies changed when they were offered the Crown conches. <italic>O</italic>. <italic>maya</italic> drilled the shell of every snail in the same place, just below the apex in the fourth or fifth suture of the shell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0148922.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). This confirms the role of the radula in <italic>O</italic>. <italic>maya</italic> when preying on gastropods. Gastropods under risk of predation retract inside the shell and close the opening with the operculum; by drilling, the octopus gained access to the visceral mass of the snail. The configuration of the resultant holes suggested the physical action of the radula (scraping, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0148922.g006">Fig 6B</xref>) and chemical action of the saliva (dissolution, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0148922.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). Our results support the evidence that the radula is active [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148922.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148922.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148922.ref047">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148922.ref048">48</xref>].</p>

<p>When octopus were offered a conch whose shell had been partially coated with dental cement to cover a previously drilled hole, they found the limit of the coating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0148922.g006">Fig 6C</xref>) and drilled a new hole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0148922.g006">Fig 6D</xref>). Although some octopods can drill both layers (e.g. <italic>O</italic>. <italic>vulgaris</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148922.ref006">6</xref>]), <italic>O</italic>. <italic>maya</italic> appears to use an easier strategy to prey upon gastropods. For instance, <italic>O</italic>. <italic>maya</italic> mostly uses its radula when the prey has hard external structures for protection. At the time of injection of the saliva, the secretion is generated in two PSGs joined by the common duct and discharged through the salivary papilla that allows it to flow into the hole and disperse through the radula. The radula is the main hard structure that octopods use for drilling, although the papilla and its front are covered with very small teeth that can function as an accessory radula [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148922.ref048">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148922.ref049">49</xref>]. However, we suggest that <italic>O</italic>. <italic>maya</italic> may only use the salivary papilla for injection of saliva into the hole drilled on the prey. An exhaustive search using a stereoscopic microscope failed to find dentition of the salivary papilla, but additional approaches are needed to determine whether such dentition is present, e.g. scanning electron microscopy.</p>
<p><italic>Octopus maya</italic> may be using the most efficient strategy to subdue its prey, since despite the functionality of the radula no drilling was observed in the predation of blue crabs. When octopus injected saliva into the arthrodial or eye puncture, the crab was paralyzed in less than one minute, a strategy that takes less time than drilling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148922.ref047">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148922.ref050">50</xref>]. If the risk of exposure while hunting is high, octopus may maximize efficiency not by optimizing energy gain but by reducing their own vulnerability to predation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148922.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148922.ref051">51</xref>]. According to our results, <italic>O</italic>. <italic>maya</italic> may be classified as a time-minimizing hunter since it appears to have similar hunting traits to those of <italic>Enteroctopus dofleini</italic> and <italic>O</italic>. <italic>insularis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148922.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148922.ref051">51</xref>].</p>
<p>The 3D ordination of samples obtained through NMDS had a stress of 0.16, indicating a “sufficiently good configuration that requires caution” in graphic interpretation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148922.ref035">35</xref>]. The configuration showed a clear separation of samples between blue crabs that had been injured in the eye and those injured in the arthrodial membrane of the last walking appendage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0148922.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). This separation appears to correlate well with the position in which crabs were placed and drawn towards the octopus just before they were enveloped by the web, as indicated by the close correspondence between samples with eye and membrane injury with vectors Col1 and Col2, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0148922.g007">Fig 7A</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0148922.t002">Table 2</xref>). These results, together with those of the permutational MANOVA (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0148922.t003">Table 3</xref>), indicate that the type of injury inflicted on crabs depends on the position in which crabs are drawn under the interbranchial membrane during the last moments of the attack.</p>

</table-wrap-foot>
</table-wrap>
<p>Most samples representing large octopus were associated with vectors Prop1, Detmi and Desp, whereas those representing small octopus were associated with vectors Detco and Ataq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0148922.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). This suggests that large octopus more frequently changed color to mimic the background and propelled rapidly towards crabs during attack (Prop1, Detmi; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0148922.g007">Fig 7B</xref>); they also often moved within the arena once the crab had been captured (Desp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0148922.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). Small octopus, by contrast, changed color but did not mimic the background during attack (Detco), and they used ambush more frequently than larger ones (Ataq, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0148922.g007">Fig 7B</xref>).</p>
<p>Regarding crab size, vector Prop2 and Col2 were behavioral descriptors associated with large crabs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0148922.g007">Fig 7C</xref>), suggesting that <italic>O</italic>. <italic>maya</italic> slowly propelled towards a large crab during attack and most prey in this size class were manipulated so that their posterior parts were towards the octopus. Small crabs were more often manipulated so that their mouthparts and rostrum were facing the octopus (Col1). Results of the permutational MANOVA confirm these descriptions since all main terms in the model contributed significantly to the ordination of samples based on the 14 behavioral variables analyzed (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0148922.t003">Table 3</xref>).</p>

<title>Onset of effect according to the injection site</title>
<p>The neurotoxic fraction was injected in both the arthrodial membrane and the eye of the blue crab, in order to determine the fastest route used by the octopus to paralyze the crab. Although the mechanisms of injection of <italic>O</italic>. <italic>maya</italic> involve a fine flow of saliva through a punctured surface and it is spread with the radula, injection with the insulin syringe was considered a sufficient simulation. Our results suggest that the arthrodial membrane is a more common puncture site than the eye. Indeed, injection on each arthrodial membrane in the pereiopods showed six potential sites on the swimming leg that led to neurotoxic effects in less than 20 s. Furthermore, accessibility of the site favored arthrodial injection, since the eye is protected by the ocular orbit. Injection on the eye also paralyzed the prey in exactly the same time as the arthrodial injection, an expected result because the chemical content of the saliva reaches the hemolymph of the crab and consequently the central nervous system.</p>

<title>Effect of the saliva of <italic>Octopus maya</italic> on the blue crab</title>
<p>The prey experienced a gradual paralysis after saliva injection by octopus. Paralysis was irreversible after 3 min of injection and was followed by death as previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148922.ref011">11</xref>]. The neurotoxic effect of saliva after different time intervals (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0148922.t004">Table 4</xref>) progressed through (1) loss of coordination, (2) immediate contraction or trembling of appendages, and (3) spasms in the rear appendages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148922.ref015">15</xref>]. These symptoms caused a gradual paralysis during the first minute, with the spontaneous movements disappearing two minutes later and the aggressive prey becoming an inert body.</p>

<p>The rapid injection of saliva of <italic>O</italic>. <italic>maya</italic> and its quick neurotoxic effect on the prey facilitates the retention of the crab under the web and avoids damage to the octopus by the cutting chelae. In addition, such effects also reduce the need for manipulation by <italic>O</italic>. <italic>maya</italic> of the inactive prey and facilitates predigestion. Comparing these results with the paralysis induced by the neurotoxic fraction isolated (F3) revealed no differences in the onset of paralysis, less than 10 s. However, the exact time when the octopus injects saliva remains an enigma; the octopus envelops its prey so tightly with its inter-arm webbing that this event is almost impossible to detect even with the use of ultrasound scanning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148922.ref011">11</xref>].</p>

<title>Effects of the neurotoxic fraction on <italic>Octopus maya</italic> conspecifics</title>
<p>The relaxing fraction (F3) had effects on <italic>O</italic>. <italic>maya</italic> conspecifics similar to those on crabs: body relaxation (5 min after injection) with color change (from red to white), decrease in aggressiveness, and paralysis at the injection site (40 min) without responses of chromatophores; clear signs of sedation on injected areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0148922.g008">Fig 8</xref>). Octopus recovered mobility and some chromatophores started to respond after 3 h, and the initial state was recovered after 5 h. Paling is an indication of the effect on chromatophores, which are innervated directly from the sub-oesophageal lobes of the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148922.ref018">18</xref>], although it is not clear whether the innervation is centrally or peripherally mediated. The reversibility of the effect is probably attributable to action on specific receptors.</p>

<p>The neurotoxic fraction was injected to determine whether the saliva can paralyze <italic>O</italic>. <italic>maya</italic> conspecifics without killing them; moreover, metabolic and neurotoxic activity may overlap. Cephalopod saliva contains biogenic amines such as serotonin, as well as neuropeptides with effects on the central and enteric nervous systems, e.g. memory, control of motor system, aggression and behavioral patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148922.ref052">52</xref>]. We found that the most conspicuous molecule in the neurotoxic fraction was serotonin. Effects of serotonin on octopods have only been reported in <italic>O</italic>. <italic>vulgaris</italic> injected with a dose of 1–10 mg that caused a mottling color change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148922.ref053">53</xref>].</p>
<p>In invertebrates, serotonin is involved in motor pattern generation, escape and social status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148922.ref039">39</xref>]. Some venoms have evolved to manipulate the monoaminergic system, such as the serotonin in <italic>O</italic>. <italic>maya</italic>, via a variety of cellular mechanisms for both offensive and defensive purposes. An early attempt to demonstrate the activity of saliva and tetrodotoxin in conspecifics of the blue ring octopus <italic>Hapalochlaena maculosa</italic> was unsuccessful, although the extract generated from PSG was active over crabs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148922.ref054">54</xref>]. Here we demonstrated that saliva is not only used as a tool for food supply but also may be used as defense and to minimize competition among conspecifics. The effects observed require the use of a high concentration of saliva and therefore of serotonin with several orders of magnitude above the concentration normally present in the saliva (50 μg/injection of saliva per octopus vs 200 μg/injection GSP). However, <italic>O</italic>. <italic>maya</italic> injects saliva into its prey several times, and hence the levels of serotonin inserted into the prey are likely to be high. In addition, octopus may inject the saliva at specific sites, where it would locally reach high concentrations but not necessarily through the circulatory system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148922.ref055">55</xref>].</p>
<p>The Directive 2010/63/EU that regulates studies on live cephalopods emphasizes that anesthesia must be used to avoid cephalopod suffering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0148922.ref026">26</xref>]; however an appropriate anesthetic has not been developed. Therefore, ongoing research in our laboratory is examining whether serotonin causes sedation in other octopuses and whether it can be used as a general anesthetic in cephalopods.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The PSG crude extract obtained was active over many species of crabs. The PSG aqueous extract presented two main activities: a metabolic effect exerted by molecules of &gt; 3 kDa (probably trypsin and chymotrypsin), and a neurotoxic action (molecules &lt; 3kDa) with paralysis and body relaxation. The bioguided separation of the neurotoxic fraction yields a paralyzing fraction with free amino acids as the principal components, whereas a relaxing fraction acts through serotonin. Interestingly, free amino acids were integrated into the feeding behavior. The neurotoxic fraction was active on <italic>O</italic>. <italic>maya</italic> conspecifics, leaving octopus as prey defenseless against predators and corroborating its likely importance in relation to cannibalistic events. The feeding behavior of <italic>O</italic>. <italic>maya</italic> when offered crabs and crown conchs is similar to that observed in other cephalopods. Although the radula was present and active, there was no evidence of its use to drill into crabs. Given that hole-boring is a time-consuming task, its absence here suggests that <italic>O</italic>. <italic>maya</italic> uses a time-minimizing strategy when hunting for this type of prey.</p>
<p><italic>Octopus maya</italic> is abundant on the Yucatan Peninsula and its diet primarily consists of several species of crabs that are also abundant in that area. Although octopuses have developed strategies to prey upon mollusks, these strategies may not be used as frequently as expected on less abundant gastropods. The paralyzing effect of salivary fluids suggests that octopuses are adapted to predation on crabs with defensive structures.</p>
