        <p>The expression of gangliosides is often associated with cancer progression. Sialyltransferases have received much attention in terms of their relationship with cancer because they modulate the expression of gangliosides. We previously demonstrated that GD1a production was high in castration-resistant prostate cancer cell lines, PC3 and DU145, mainly due to their high expression of β-galactoside α2,3-sialyltransferase (ST3Gal) II (not ST3Gal I), and the expression of both ST3Gals was regulated by NF-κB, mainly by RelB. We herein demonstrate that GD1a was produced in abundance in cancerous tissue samples from human patients with hormone-sensitive prostate cancers as well as castration-resistant prostate cancers. The expression of ST3Gal II was constitutively activated in castration-resistant prostate cancer cell lines, PC3 and DU145, because of the hypomethylation of CpG island in its promoter. However, in androgen-depleted LNCap cells, a hormone-sensitive prostate cancer cell line, the expression of ST3Gal II was silenced because of the hypermethylation of the promoter region. The expression of ST3Gal II in LNCap cells increased with testosterone treatment because of the demethylation of the CpG sites. This testosterone-dependent ST3Gal II expression was suppressed by RelB siRNA, indicating that RelB activated ST3Gal II transcription in the testosterone-induced demethylated promoter. Therefore, in hormone-sensitive prostate cancers, the production of GD1a may be regulated by androgen. This is the first report indicating that the expression of a sialyltransferase is transcriptionally regulated by androgen-dependent demethylation of the CpG sites in its gene promoter.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Many cancer cells have aberrant sialylated glycans on their surface. These aberrant molecules may be involved in cancer progression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031234-DallOlio1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031234-Birkl1">[3]</xref>, but sialylated glycans also play many roles in healthy organisms and non-cancer cells, including embryogenesis, regulation of the immune response and virus binding that leads to infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031234-Yamashita1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031234-Varki1">[5]</xref>. Sialylated glycans are synthesized by sialyltransferases, which add sialic acids to the oligosaccharide chains of glycoproteins and glycosphingolipids (GSLs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031234-Varki1">[5]</xref>. To date, 20 sialyltransferase genes have been cloned, and the respective enzymes have been grouped into four families according to the carbohydrate linkages they catalyze: β-galactoside α2,3-sialyltransferases (ST3Gal I–VI), β-galactoside α2,6-sialyltransferases (ST6Gal I and II), GalNAc α2,6-sialyltransferases (ST6GalNAc I–VI), and α2,8-sialyltransferases (ST8Sia I–VI) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031234-Takashima1">[6]</xref>. During neoplastic transformation and cancer progression, the activity of sialyltransferases is often altered, and consequently, cancer cells have more heavily sialylated glycans on their surface than non-cancer cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031234-DallOlio1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031234-Hakomori1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031234-Bos1">[7]</xref>.</p>
      <p>GSLs that contain sialic acids are known as gangliosides and are expressed at high levels in various cancer cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031234-Birkl1">[3]</xref>. The gangliosides present on cancer cells are used as biomarkers or treatment targets, and the enriched gangliosides differ between cancer cell types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031234-Houghton1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031234-Yu1">[10]</xref>. We have focused on GD1a synthesis in cancer cells because GD1a has several biological actions that promote cancer progression. For example, highly metastatic cancer cells have abundant GD1a, and GD1a is involved in cancer cell adhesion to endothelial cells during metastasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031234-Taki1">[11]</xref>. The GD1a shed by tumor cells in the tumor microenvironment promotes angiogenesis and enhances growth factor signaling by increasing the dimerization of growth factor receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031234-Li1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031234-Liu2">[15]</xref>. Therefore, GD1a may be involved in cancer cell proliferation and metastasis. Furthermore, this ganglioside is a receptor for the Sendai virus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031234-Villar1">[16]</xref>, and inactivated Sendai virus particles [hemagglutinating virus of Japan envelope (HVJ-E)] induce apoptosis in several human cancer cells with enriched GD1a on their surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031234-Kawaguchi1">[17]</xref>. Therefore, GD1a may be an attractive molecule from the viewpoint of cancer therapy.</p>
      <p>GD1a has been reported to be abundantly produced in castration-resistant prostate cancer cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031234-Kawaguchi1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031234-Hatano1">[20]</xref>, and we previously demonstrated that castration-resistant prostate cancer cells were effectively eradicated by HVJ-E <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031234-Kawaguchi1">[17]</xref>. GD1a is synthesized from GM1 by ST3Gal I and II. The Km value of ST3Gal II for GM1 is smaller than that of ST3Gal I; thus, ST3Gal II preferentially contributes to GD1a synthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031234-Takashima1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031234-Lee1">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031234-Kono1">[24]</xref>. We recently demonstrated that abundant production of GD1a in castration-resistant prostate cancer cells is correlated with the high levels of ST3Gal II expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031234-Hatano1">[20]</xref> and that ST3Gal II expression is regulated by NF-κB, mainly by RelB, in castration-resistant prostate cancer cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031234-Hatano1">[20]</xref>. Although the RelB levels were similar in a hormone-sensitive prostate cancer cell line (LNCap) and castration-resistant prostate cancer cells, and although ST3Gal I was expressed in LNCap cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031234-Hatano1">[20]</xref>, the expression of ST3Gal II was silenced in LNCap cells, and GD1a was much less abundant in the LNCap cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031234-Kawaguchi1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031234-Hatano1">[20]</xref>.</p>
      <p>There has so far been no published analysis of the ganglioside levels in cancerous tissue samples from human patients with prostate cancer; however, an endogenous immune response to GD1a was observed in patients with hormone-sensitive prostate cancer, but not in healthy controls <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031234-Ravindranath2">[19]</xref>, thus suggesting that GD1a is abundantly produced in hormone-sensitive prostate cancers. Prostate cancer exhibits androgen-dependent growth and progression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031234-Heinlein1">[25]</xref>; therefore, androgens may also regulate the GD1a production that is related to cancer progression. However, there have also been no published studies that have examined the hormonal control of sialylated glycan synthesis.</p>
      <p>The aim of this study was to determine whether GD1a is produced in abundance in hormone-sensitive prostate cancers in patients and to analyze the transcriptional control of sialyltransferases, especially ST3Gal II, required for the synthesis of GD1a in hormone-sensitive prostate cancers.</p>

Human genomic DNA or enzymatically methylated human genomic DNA (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA) was bisulfite-converted and used as a positive control for the unmethylated or methylated genes. The absence of a DNA template served as a negative control. The products were analyzed in 2% agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide.</p>

The majority of experimental procedures have been reported previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031234-Korekane1">[28]</xref>. In brief, the acidic GSLs were extracted from primary cancer tissue samples or cultured cancer cells and digested with recombinant endoglycoceramidase II from <italic>Rhodococcus</italic> sp.

The released oligosaccharides were labeled with 2-aminopyridine (2-AP) and separated on a Shimadzu LC-20A HPLC system (Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan) equipped with a Waters 2475 fluorescence detector. Normal-phase HPLC was performed on a TSK gel Amide-80 column (0.2×25 cm, Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan). The molecular size of each pyridylaminated (PA)-oligosaccharide is given in glucose units (Gu) based on the elution times of PA-isomaltooligosaccharides. Reversed-phase HPLC was performed on a TSK gel ODS-80Ts column (0.2×15 cm, Tosoh). The retention time of each PA-oligosaccharide is given in glucose units based on the elution times of the PA-isomaltooligosaccharides. Therefore, the behaviors of a given compound in these two columns provide a unique set of Gu (amide) and Gu (ODS) values, which correspond to coordinates on a 2-D map. PA-oligosaccharides were analyzed by LC/ESI MS/MS. Standard PA-oligosaccharides, PA-GM1 and PA-GD1a, were purchased from Takara Bio, and PA-LST-a and PA-SPG were isolated as in our previous study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031234-Korekane1">[28]</xref>.</p>

        <title>Androgen-dependent regulation of ST3Gal II in LNCap cells</title>
        <p>The synthesis of GD1a is mainly regulated by ST3Gal II, and the expression of ST3Gal II is regulated by NF-κB, mainly by RelB, in castration-resistant prostate cancer cell lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031234-Hatano1">[20]</xref>. The amounts of nuclear RelB were similar in hormone-sensitive LNCap cells and castration-resistant PC3 and DU145 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031234-Hatano1">[20]</xref>, but the expression of ST3Gal II was lower in the LNCap cells than in the PC3 and DU145 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031234-Hatano1">[20]</xref>.</p>
        <p>The LNCap cell culture medium is routinely supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). A recent report showed that media supplemented with 10% FBS contains only castrate levels of testosterone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031234-Sedelaar1">[29]</xref>; in contrast, hormone-sensitive prostate cancers of untreated patients usually grow in an environment containing testosterone <italic>in vivo</italic>. To analyze the transcriptional control of ST3Gal II in hormone-sensitive prostate cancers, we examined whether the expression of ST3Gal II was controlled by testosterone in LNCap cells. LNCap cells were treated with testosterone (0–1000 nM), and were incubated for 120 h. The quantitative real-time PCR analyses showed that the expression of ST3Gal II was higher in LNCap cells treated with testosterone than in the LNCap cells that were not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031234-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). Furthermore, the induction of ST3Gal II after testosterone treatment was suppressed by an anti-androgen, bicalutamide, in LNCap cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031234-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). To ensure that there were no androgens present in the media, LNCap cells were incubated in charcoal-stripped serum for 48 h. The basal level of ST3Gal II was not significantly different between the 10% FBS- and charcoal stripped serum-supplemented LNCap cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031234-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). The LNCap cells were subsequently treated with 100 nM testosterone, and the time-course of expression following testosterone treatment was evaluated. The expression of ST3Gal II was increased 48 h after testosterone treatment, and remained elevated for more than 120 h in the LNCap cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031234-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). To evaluate the NF-κB activity after testosterone treatment, LNCap cells were transfected with an NF-κB luciferase reporter construct and incubated for 120 h with or without testosterone. The NF-κB activity was not significantly different in the testosterone-treated LNCap cells compared to the cells cultured without testosterone (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0031234.s001">Figure S1</xref>). In PC3 and PNT2 cells, no significant increase in the expression of ST3Gal II was detected regardless of whether the cells cultured with or without testosterone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031234-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). The expression of ST3Gal II did not increase after testosterone treatment in the PC3 cells at any time point up to 120 h (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0031234.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Based on these findings, we hypothesized that the media with castrate levels of testosterone led to the epigenetic silencing of ST3Gal, a gene required for the synthesis of GD1a, in LNCap cells.</p>

Genomic DNA was isolated from LNCap cells treated with or without 5-azadC for 120 h, that were then treated with sodium bisulfite, and the DNA was amplified with primers specific for the unmethylated or the methylated ST3Gal II promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031234-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). In LNCap cells, the CpG island in the ST3Gal II promoter, which was originally hypermethylated, was demethylated by 5-azadC treatment. Next, we examined the effect of testosterone on the methylation at the CpG in the ST3Gal II promoter in LNCap cells using a MSP analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031234-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>). In the PC3 and DU145 cells, the CpG island of the ST3Gal II promoter was constitutively hypomethylated. In the LNCap cells, the CpG island of the ST3Gal II promoter was hypermethylated in the absence of testosterone and demethylated in the presence of testosterone. Furthermore, the demethylation at the CpG island in the ST3Gal II promoter after testosterone treatment was suppressed by an anti-androgen, bicalutamide, in LNCap cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031234-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>).</p>

        <p>We also examined whether global DNA demethylation is under androgen-dependent control in LNCap cells.

We then examined the CpG island of GSTP1, which is reported to be hypermethylated during prostate carcinogenesis and also in LNCap cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031234-Nakayama1">[27]</xref>. Based on the MSP analysis, testosterone treatment did not affect the methylation of GSTP1 in LNCap cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0031234.s003">Figure S3B</xref>). Thus, the androgen-dependent control of DNA demethylation may be induced preferentially at the CpG island in the ST3Gal II gene promoter in LNCap cells.</p>

        <title>Androgen-dependent and epigenetic regulation of ST3Gal I in LNCap cells</title>
        <p>Although GD1a is synthesized from GM1 mainly by ST3Gal II, ST3Gal I may also contribute to the synthesis of GD1a <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031234-Takashima1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031234-Lee1">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031234-Kono1">[24]</xref>.

Therefore, the regulation of ST3Gal I transcription may be different from that of ST3Gal II. We thereafter examined whether the expression of ST3Gal I, like ST3Gal II, was controlled by testosterone in LNCap cells. In this experiment, the LNCap cells were treated with testosterone and incubated for 120 h. The quantitative real-time PCR analyses showed that testosterone treatment resulted in increased expression of ST3Gal I in LNCap cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031234-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>), although the expression of ST3Gal VI, the sialyltransferase required for the synthesis of sialyl paragloboside, was not induced by testosterone treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0031234.s004">Figure S4</xref>). Furthermore, the testosterone-mediated induction of ST3Gal I in LNCap cells was suppressed by bicalutamide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031234-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>). To ensure that there were no androgens present in the cell culture media, LNCap cells were incubated in charcoal-stripped serum for 48 h. The basal level of ST3Gal I was not significantly different between the LNCap cells cultured with 10% FBS and charcoal-stripped serum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031234-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>). Then, the LNCap cells were treated with 100 nM testosterone, and the time-course of the changes following testosterone treatment was evaluated. The expression of ST3Gal I increased 72 h after testosterone treatment and remained elevated for more than 120 h in LNCap cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031234-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>). In PC3 and PNT2 cells, no significant increase in the expression of ST3Gal I was detected after testosterone treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0031234.s005">Figure S5</xref>).</p>

        <p>Next, we examined whether the regulation of ST3Gal I was epigenetic in LNCap cells, as was the case for ST3Gal II. The LNCap cells were treated with 5-azadC and incubated for 120 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031234-g005">Fig. 5D</xref>). The quantitative real-time PCR analyses showed that the expression of ST3Gal I was up-regulated by 5-azadC treatment. Next, LNCap cells were treated with TSA, and incubated for 48 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031234-g005">Fig. 5E</xref>). The quantitative real-time PCR analyses showed that the expression of ST3Gal I was up-regulated by TSA treatment. Thus, the regulation of ST3Gal I, like the regulation of ST3Gal II, may be epigenetic and androgen-dependent in LNCap cells. It was previously reported that the p1 promoter of the human ST3Gal I gene is necessary for the active transcription of the gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031234-Taniguchi2">[31]</xref>. The ST3Gal I promoter sequences are publically available, and, like ST3Gal II, we identified a CpG island in the ST3Gal I p1 promoter using the Methyl Primer Express Software program, version 1.0 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0031234.s006">Figure S6A</xref>).

Thus, the methylation status of the CpG islands which affect the gene expression levels are different between ST3Gal I and II.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Gangliosides have been widely investigated because of their relationship with cancer progression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031234-Birkl1">[3]</xref>. GD1a also appears to be related to cancer cell proliferation and metastasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031234-Taki1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031234-Liu2">[15]</xref>. As demonstrated in this study, GD1a was produced in abundance in cancerous tissue samples from human patients with hormone-sensitive prostate cancers as well as those with castration-resistant prostate cancers. However, little is known about the regulation of GD1a production. To address this lack of information, we have been focusing on the transcription of the ST3Gal II gene, which is required for the synthesis of GD1a. We previously reported that ST3Gal II was up-regulated in human castration-resistant prostate cancer cells and that the expression of ST3Gal II is regulated by NF-κB, mainly by RelB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031234-Hatano1">[20]</xref>. Furthermore, a recent report showed that RelB is activated in human prostate cancers in patients with high Gleason scores <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031234-Lessard1">[32]</xref>. As demonstrated in this study, the expression of ST3Gal II was constitutively activated and androgen-independent in castration-resistant prostate cancer cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031234-g002">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0031234.s002">Figure S2</xref>) because the CpG island in the ST3Gal II promoter was hypomethylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031234-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). However, in androgen-depleted LNCap cells, a hormone-sensitive prostate cancer cell line, ST3Gal II was not up-regulated in spite of the activation of RelB.</p>
      <p>We herein demonstrated that the expression of the ST3Gal II required for the production of GD1a was epigenetically silenced under androgen-depleted conditions and was up-regulated by androgen-treatment in hormone-sensitive prostate cancer cells. The CpG island of the ST3Gal II promoter was hypermethylated under androgen-depleted conditions and was demethylated by androgen treatment in hormone-sensitive prostate cancer cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031234-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). The presence of the androgen may promote a chromatin environment where RelB can activate the transcription of ST3Gal II in hormone-sensitive prostate cancer cells. Thus, in hormone-sensitive prostate cancers, the production of GD1a may be regulated by androgen, which can modulate the methylation state of the CpG sites in the promoter region of a sialyltransferase gene.</p>
      <p>Although effects of androgen on NF-κB activity have been reported, the topic remains controversial. One report showed that androgen treatment repressed the NF-κB activity through maintenance of the IκBα protein levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031234-Keller1">[33]</xref>, but another report showed that the NF-κB DNA binding activity increased after androgen treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031234-Ripple1">[34]</xref>. In the present manuscript, the NF-κB activity was not significantly different between the testosterone-treated LNCap cells compared to the cells cultured without testosterone (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0031234.s001">Figure S1</xref>). The two routes in NF-κB signaling are the canonical pathway, which involves the complex formed between RelA and p50, and the non-canonical pathway, in which the complex formed between RelB and p52 is involved <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031234-Bollrath1">[35]</xref>. The different subunits of NF-κB may be differently regulated by androgens. Although the levels of nuclear RelA and p52 were not elevated after androgen treatment in a previous report <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031234-Ripple1">[34]</xref>, it is still unknown whether androgens can modulate the level of RelB. In the present study, we showed that the levels of RelB protein were not greatly modulated by androgens in the cell lines examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031234-g006">Fig. 6</xref>).</p>
      <p>Although GD1a is synthesized from GM1 mainly by ST3Gal II, ST3Gal I may also contribute to the synthesis of GD1a <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031234-Takashima1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031234-Lee1">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031234-Kono1">[24]</xref>. We found that the expression of ST3Gal I was up-regulated by 5-azadC treatment in LNCap cells, indicating that the expression of ST3Gal I may be regulated by DNA methylation, as is the case for ST3Gal II. However, methylation at the CpG island in the ST3Gal I promoter was not detected in LNCap cells by a MSP analysis. This suggests that the methylation of a genome region other than the CpG island may affect the expression of ST3Gal I. Thus, the methylation status of CpG islands which affect the gene expression are different between ST3Gal I and II. As previously reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031234-Hatano1">[20]</xref>, in LNCap cells, ST3Gal I was expressed, while ST3Gal II expression was silenced. The differences in the methylation of the CpG island between ST3Gal I and II may result in the differences in the expression of these two genes in LNCap cells. Based on publically available data and previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031234-Lupien1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031234-Wang1">[37]</xref>, we identified that ST3Gal II has one highly probable androgen receptor recruitment site −39.5 kb of the transcription start site of the ST3Gal II p1 promoter, and that the ST3Gal I has two highly probable androgen receptor recruitment sites −13.9 kb and −42.6 kb of the transcription start site of the ST3Gal I p1 promoter. Thus, as there are differences in the methylation status of CpG islands, the regulation of promoter methylation by the androgen receptor might also be different between ST3Gal I and II.</p>
      <p>The progression of many cancers is epigenetically regulated. DNA demethylation changes have been reported to occur later in prostate carcinogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031234-Yegnasubramanian1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031234-Nelson1">[39]</xref>. We first demonstrated that the androgen-dependent activation of transcription was induced by demethylation of CpG promoter region in ST3Gal II. Recently, several reports have shown that DNA methylation can be controlled by hormone receptors. For example, the estrogen receptor directly modifies the methylation status of the pS2 gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031234-Mtivier1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031234-Kangaspeska1">[41]</xref>, and the glucocorticoid receptor could also modify the DNA methylation status <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031234-Wiench1">[42]</xref>. Another report showed that DNA methylation/demethylation was hormonally altered to control the transcription of the cytochrome p450 27B1 gene, and that the 5-methyl-CpG binding domain family (MBD) protein activated by hormonal stimulation seemed to complete the DNA demethylation in the MBD-bound promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031234-Kim1">[43]</xref>. In the present study, we demonstrated that demethylation of the ST3Gal II promoter was induced by androgen treatment in hormone-sensitive prostate cancer cells. Although the mechanism is currently unclear, the MBD protein may be involved in this type of androgen-induced DNA demethylation. Further research is needed to elucidate the mechanism underlying the hormonal control of the DNA methylation/demethylation of the ST3Gal II promoter.</p>
      <p>Androgen plays a pivotal role in the development, growth, and progression of prostate cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031234-Heinlein1">[25]</xref>. Although we have herein shown the androgen-dependent activation of ST3Gal II by the demethylation of CpG promoter region, other genes may also be epigenetically regulated by androgen treatment in hormone-sensitive prostate cancer cells. Although we focused on DNA methylation at the CpG island in the ST3Gal promoter in the current manuscript, it is known that DNA methylation is linked to histone deacetylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031234-Ng1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031234-Sharma1">[45]</xref>. Therefore, in future studies, we plan to elucidate the mechanism underlying the regulation on histone modification by androgen, in addition to the effects on DNA methylation.</p>
      <p>GD1a should be focused also from the view of cancer therapy. Several gene therapy approaches for the treatment of prostate cancer have been clinically tested <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031234-Freytag1">[46]</xref>. Oncolytic viruses have been developed to selectively augment the anti-tumor effects, and some viruses, such as adenovirus and the herpes simplex virus, are used to combat prostate cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031234-Li2">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031234-CasteloBranco1">[48]</xref>. Recently, we reported that inactivated Sendai virus particles (HVJ-E) selectively induced apoptosis in human castration-resistant prostate cancer cells by retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I)–mediated gene expression and the induction of anti-tumor immunities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031234-Kawaguchi1">[17]</xref>. A ganglioside, GD1a, which is enriched in human castration-resistant prostate cancer cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031234-Kawaguchi1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031234-Hatano1">[20]</xref> is one of the receptors for the Sendai virus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031234-Villar1">[16]</xref>; therefore, HVJ-E is expected to be a novel therapeutic tool for prostate cancers. However, HVJ-E did not induce apoptosis in LNCap cells, a human hormone-sensitive prostate cancer cell line, because these cells did not express a viral receptor ganglioside, such as GD1a <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031234-Kawaguchi1">[17]</xref>, on their cell surface. The present study showed that GD1a was produced in clinical samples of hormone-sensitive prostate cancers and of castration-resistant prostate cancers. We are currently analyzing the mechanism underlying the cancer-selective apoptosis induced by HVJ-E, and our preliminary data suggest that both castration-resistant and hormone-sensitive prostate cancers may be treated by HVJ-E. Thus, this study will also be important to determine the indications for treating prostate cancer patients with HVJ-E.</p>

The genomic DNA isolated from untreated LNCap cells or LNCap cells treated with 100 nM testosterone for 120 h was digested using <italic>Msp</italic>I or <italic>Hpa</italic>II for 16 h at 37°C. The digested DNA was analyzed in 2% agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide. (B) The results of the MSP analysis of GSTP1. The genomic DNA isolated from untreated LNCap cells or LNCap cells treated with 100 nM testosterone for 120 h was amplified with primers specific for the unmethylated (USP) or the methylated (MSP) GSTP1 promoter after treatment with sodium bisulfite (M, methylated control; UA, unmethylated control A; UB, unmethylated control B). The MSP analyses were repeated 3 times with the same result and a representative image shown in the figure.</p>
